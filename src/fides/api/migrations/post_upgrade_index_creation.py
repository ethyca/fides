"""
This utility is used to detect indices or constraints that were deferred as part
of a standard Fides/Alembic migration.

The standard approach for creating indices or constraints on large tables is a blocking operation,
meaning reads and write can't run while the indices and constraints are being created.
A non-blocking approach is to use the CONCURRENTLY keyword for index creation then adding
the constraints with ADD CONSTRAINT USING INDEX.

However these approaches cannot run in a transaction, which is what Fides/Alembic uses to
apply migrations. The approach here is to run these commands after the application has started
up and commit the changes immediately, outside of a transaction.

The commands that need to run are denoted in the `TABLE_OBJECT_MAP`. Indices that are used
to create constraints also include the `constraint_name` value since either the presence of
the index or the constraint can be used to determine if an index has executed.
When using the ADD CONSTRAINT USING INDEX syntax, the index specified in the command is
automatically renamed to match the name of the constraint being added.
This means that after the constraint is created, the index will have the same name as the constraint.
