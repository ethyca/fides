    Loads all the sample connection YAML files from the sample project by

    `PATCH /api/v1/connection` API.

    While parsing the YAML file, this also performs ENV variable expansion,
    similar to what Docker/Bash/etc. support. This allows secrets to be provided
    as ENV var names (e.g. $FIDES_DEPLOY__CONNECTORS__POSTGRES__PASSWORD) and
    replaced with "real" values at runtime.

    After parsing the models, this function then *excludes* any connection missing
    any of it's secrets. This prevents gotchas with failing connections at runtime
    and also makes it easy to programmatically control which connections should be
    enabled by simply adding/removing the secrets to the config file.

    Returns a list of models, ready to be upserted!

    NOTE: This function does quite a bit of magic that the CLI/API/etc. don't
    support today, so it is likely to fall out of sync or break surprisingly.
    We've added extra tests that are designed to be defensive and warn us if
    something drifts.
