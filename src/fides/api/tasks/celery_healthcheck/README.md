This is a copy of celery-healthcheck - it's added here manually because our current 
pinned dependencies are not compatible with the package's pinned dependencies (but 
they do work with the code). Once we upgrade fastapi and a few other dependencies, 
we can remove this (if we want - it's MIT licensed so this is reasonable).
