"""
Startup queue migration — drain Redis Celery queues into SQS.

When the ``use_sqs_queue`` feature flag flips on for the first time, any
tasks already queued in Redis would be orphaned because Celery workers are
about to start polling SQS instead.  This module provides a zero-loss
cutover: on startup it acquires a distributed Redis lock, reads pending
task messages from every known Celery queue in Redis, deletes the keys,
and re-enqueues the messages to the corresponding SQS queue in batches of
10 (the SQS ``SendMessageBatch`` cap).

The migration is idempotent (safe to call on every startup) — a subsequent
run with empty Redis queues is a no-op that returns zero counts.

The lock is always released via ``try/finally`` and has a short TTL so a
crashed process does not permanently block subsequent migration attempts.

       acquire a distributed lock so only one process migrates at a time.
