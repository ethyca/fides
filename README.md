## :zap: Overview

Fides (*fee-dez*, Latin: FidÄ“s) is the modern framework for data teams to implement data privacy requirements using all your existing CI/CD tools.

- **A Privacy Grammar for engineers.** Fides is a way for you to declare when, where and how you plan to use risky types of data (e.g., personally identifiable information) directly in your code.

- **Privacy Policies that aren't just for lawyers.** Fides allows you to make a privacy policy that's *actually* enforced at time of integration and deployment.

- **CI/CD/CP.** Update your policies and data systems as frequently as you (or your legal team!) needs. The updated policies will continuously evaluate compliance and warn users of unsafe changes _before_ they make it into production.

- **Built to scale.** Lots of databases? Tons of microservices? Large distributed infrastructure? Fides defines the data privacy taxonomy that allows for both lawyers and engineers to work together with a common language, so that the policies and rules can be applied across the entire data ecosystem.

## :bulb: Concepts

Fides has two fundamental parts at its core. The first part is the 4 privacy data types that Fides defines:

The 4 data privacy types are as follows:

- Data Subject - _Whose_ data is it?
- Data Category - _What_ kind of data is it?
- Data Use - _How_ is it being used?
- Data Qualifier - How _identifiable_ is it?

With these privacy data types defined, subsequent resources can now be defined within their scopes. Those subsequent resources comprise the second part of Fides, they are as follows:

- Dataset - Tables and fields described as a combination of Data Categories and Data Qualifiers
- System - Defined as a list of declarations comprising all 4 privacy data types
- Policy - Defined as a list of rules comprising all 4 privacy data types, specifiying which combinations are either permitted or forbidden

Using these primitives, as well as some additional abstractions for syntactic sugar, Fides facilitates comprehensive privacy annotations for entire datascapes.

## :rocket: Quick Start

First, follow the [Getting Started with Docker](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/getting_started/docker.md) guide until you're able to run `fidesctl ping` successfully:
```bash
root@796cfde906f1:/fides/fidesctl# fidesctl ping
Pinging http://fidesapi:8080...
Ping Successful!
```

For a detailed walkthrough, we recommend following [our tutorial here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/tutorial.md), but if you're looking for a quick start you can follow these 5 easy steps:

1. Launch a shell with `make cli` and confirm you can `fidesctl ping` (see above).

1. Create a directory for your Fides resources to live in:

    ```bash
    mkdir fides_resources/
    ```

1. Copy the example `System` resource to a new file, `fides_resources/system.yaml`. It's a basic demo system with a single declaration which demonstrates the basic syntax:

    <details>
        <summary>Example system.yaml to get you started</summary>

      ```yaml
    system:
      - organization_parent_key: 1
        fidesKey: "demo_system"
        name: "Demo System"
        description: "A system used for demos."
        systemType: "Service"
        privacyDeclarations:
          - name: "Analyze Anonymous Content"
            dataCategories:
              - "account_data"
            dataUse: "provide"
            dataQualifier: "anonymized_data"
            dataSubjects:
              - "customer"
      ```
    </details>

1. Copy the example `Policy` resource to a new file, `fides_resources/policy.yaml`. It contains two example rules that you can evaluate against:

    <details>
    <summary>Example policy.yaml to get you started</summary>

      ```yaml
    policy:
      - organization_parent_key: 1
        fides_key: "primary_privacy_policy"
        name: "Primary Privacy Policy"
        description: "The main privacy policy for our organization."
        rules:
          - organization_parent_key: 1
            fides_key: "reject_targeted_marketing"
            name: "Reject Targeted Marketing"
            description: "Disallow marketing that is targeted towards users."
            dataCategories:
              inclusion: "ANY"
              values:
                - profiling_data
                - account_data
                - derived_data
                - cloud_service_provider_data
            dataUses:
              inclusion: ANY
              values:
                - market_advertise_or_promote
                - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
            dataSubjects:
              inclusion: ANY
              values:
                - trainee
                - commuter
            dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
            action: REJECT
          - organization_parent_key: 1
            fides_key: "reject_some_marketing"
            name: "Reject Some Marketing"
            description: "Disallow some marketing that is targeted towards users."
            dataCategories:
              inclusion: ANY
              values:
                - user_location
                - personal_health_data_and_medical_records
                - connectivity_data
                - credentials
            dataUses:
              inclusion: ALL
              values:
                - improvement_of_business_support_for_contracted_service
                - personalize
                - share_when_required_to_provide_the_service
            dataSubjects:
              inclusion: NONE
              values:
                - trainee
                - commuter
                - patient
            dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
            action: REJECT
      ```

    </details>

1. Evaluate your `System` and `Policy` resources using `fidesctl evaluate fides_resources/`. This will parse those resource files and evaluate the policy rules against the system to ensure everything is compliant:
```
root@55550d834f96:/fides/fidesctl# fidesctl evaluate fides_resources/
Loading resource manifests from: fides_resources/
Taxonomy successfully created.
----------
Processing system resources...
CREATED 1 system resources.
UPDATED 0 system resources.
SKIPPED 0 system resources.
----------
Processing policy resources...
CREATED 1 policy resources.
UPDATED 0 policy resources.
SKIPPED 0 policy resources.
----------
Loading resource manifests from: fides_resources/
Taxonomy successfully created.
Evaluating the following policies:
primary_privacy_policy
test_policy_1
----------
Checking for missing resources...
Executing evaluations...
Sending the evaluation results to the server...

```

Congrats, you've successfully declared a few resources and evaluated a policy!

Now we'd really recommend doing [the tutorial](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/tutorial.md) to keep learning.
