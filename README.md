## :zap: Overview

Fides (*fee-dhez*, Latin: FidÄ“s) is an open-source tool that allows you to easily [declare your systems' privacy characteristics](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/system/), [track privacy related changes](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/policy/) to systems and data in version control, and [enforce policies](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/pass/#evaluate-the-fidesctl-policies) in both your source code and [your runtime infrastructure](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/deployment/#step-5-install-fidesctl-cli-on-ci-build-server).
