## :zap: Overview

Fides (*fee-dez*, Latin: FidÄ“s) is the modern framework for data teams to implement data privacy requirements using all your existing CI/CD tools.

- **A Privacy Grammar for Engineers.** Fides is a way for you to declare when, where and how you plan to use risky types of data (e.g. personally identifiable information) directly in your code. 

- **Privacy Policies That Aren't Just for Lawyers.** Fides allows you to make a privacy policy that's *actually* enforced at time of integration and deployment.

- **CI/CD/CP.** Update your policies and data systems as frequently as you (or your legal team!) needs. The updated policies will continuously evaluate compliance and warn users of unsafe changes _before_ they make it into production.

- **Built to Scale.** Lots of databases? Tons of microservices? Large distributed infrastructure? Fides defines the data privacy taxonomy that allows for both lawyers and engineers to work together with a common language, so that the policies and rules can be applied across the entire data ecosystem.


## :rocket: Getting Started 

We recommend getting started with [our tutorial here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/tutorial.md), but it's just as easy to jump right in with 5 easy steps:

1. Install the fides CLI using Docker ([detailed instructions here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/getting_started/docker.md))
```
docker pull ethyca/fidesctl:latest
```

2. Create a directory for your Fides resources to live in, like `fides_resources/`.
```
mkdir fides_resources/
```

3. Let's make our first policy, you don't even need a lawyer :wink:  using our template, modify and add what ever rules you'd like
  <details>
    <summary>Here's an example policy .yaml to get you started</summary>

    ```yaml
  policy:
    - organizationId: 1
      fidesKey: "primaryPrivacyPolicy"
      name: "Primary Privacy Policy"
      description: "The main privacy policy for the organization."
      rules:
        - organizationId: 1
          fidesKey: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
          name: "Reject Targeted Marketing"
          description: "Disallow marketing that is targeted towards users."
          dataCategories:
            inclusion: "ANY"
            values:
              - profiling_data
              - account_data
              - derived_data
              - cloud_service_provider_data
          dataUses:
            inclusion: ANY
            values:
              - market_advertise_or_promote
              - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
          dataSubjects:
            inclusion: ANY
            values:
              - trainee
              - commuter
          dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
          action: REJECT
        - organizationId: 1
          fidesKey: rejectSome
          name: "Reject Some Marketing"
          description: "Disallow some marketing that is targeted towards users."
          dataCategories:
            inclusion: ANY
            values:
              - user_location
              - personal_health_data_and_medical_records
              - connectivity_data
              - credentials
          dataUses:
            inclusion: ALL
            values:
              - improvement_of_business_support_for_contracted_service
              - personalize
              - share_when_required_to_provide_the_service
          dataSubjects:
            inclusion: NONE
            values:
              - trainee
              - commuter
              - patient
          dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
          action: REJECT
    ```
  </details>


4. And now, create a data system for Fides to check your data privacy policy against. 
  <details>
      <summary>Here's an example system .yaml to get you started</summary>

    ```yaml
  system:
    - organizationId: 1
      fidesKey: "demoSystem"
      name: "Demo System"
      description: "A system used for demos."
      systemType: "Service"
      privacyDeclarations:
        - name: "Analyze Anonymous Content"
          dataCategories:
            - "account_data"
          dataUse: "provide"
          dataQualifier: "anonymized_data"
          dataSubjects:
            - "anonymous_user"
          datasetReferences:
            - "sample_db_dataset.Email"
      systemDependencies: []
    ```
  </details>


5. Send all your resources to the server using `fidesctl apply fides_manifests/` and that's it! See how your data set stacks up against the policy by using `fidesctl evaluate`

And ICYMI, we really recommend doing [the tutorial](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/tutorial.md)? It's helpful to contextualize how you can use Fides in your organization, today.
