## :zap: Overview

Fides (*fee-dhez*, Latin: FidÄ“s) is an open-source tool that allows you to easily [declare your systems' privacy characteristics](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/system/), [track privacy related changes](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/policy/) to systems and data in version control, and [enforce policies](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/pass/#evaluate-the-fidesctl-policies) in both your source code and [your runtime infrastructure](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/deployment/#step-5-install-fidesctl-cli-on-ci-build-server).

## :rocket: Quick Start 

1. Getting fidesctl set up on your machine

    <details>
    <summary>Clone the fidesctl repo</summary>

    `git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides.git`

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Install fidesctl</summary>

    `pip install fidesctl`

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Initialiaze fidesctl</summary>

    `fidesctl init`

    </details>

2. Use the `evaluate` command to see if this project's demo resources comply with our demo policies. 

    <details>
    <summary>Run a local evaluation</summary>

    `fidesctl --local evaluate fides/fidesctl/demo_resources/`

    </details>

    Congratulations, you've successfully run your first fidesctl evaluation!

3. Now, take a closer look at `fides/fidesctl/demo_resources/demo_policy.yml` which describes an organization's privacy policy as code. This policy just includes one rule: fail if any system uses contact information for marketing purposes.

    <details>
      <summary><code>cat fides/fidesctl/demo_resources/demo_policy.yml</code></summary>

      ```yaml
      policy:
        - fides_key: demo_privacy_policy
          name: Demo Privacy Policy
          description: The main privacy policy for the organization.
          rules:
            - fides_key: reject_direct_marketing
              name: Reject Direct Marketing
              description: Disallow collecting any user contact info to use for marketing.
              data_categories:
                matches: ANY
                values:
                  - user.provided.identifiable.contact
              data_uses:
                matches: ANY
                values:
                  - advertising
              data_subjects:
                matches: ANY
                values:
                  - customer
              data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified
      ```

      </details>


4. Lastly, we're going to modify our annotations in a way that would fail the policy we just looked at:

    <details>
    <summary>Add User-provided contact info to the <code>demo_marketing_system</code></summary>

     ```diff
          privacy_declarations:
            - name: Collect data for marketing
              data_categories:
     -          #- user.provided.identifiable.contact # uncomment to add this category to the system
     +          - user.provided.identifiable.contact # uncomment to add this category to the system
                - user.derived.identifiable.device.cookie_id
              data_uses: marketing_advertising_or_promotion
              data_subjects:
     ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Run another fidesctl evaluation</summary>


     ```sh
     root@fa175a43c077:/fides/fidesctl# fidesctl evaluate demo_resources
     ...
     Executing evaluations...
     {
       "status": "FAIL",
       "details": [
         "Declaration (Collect data for marketing) of System (demo_marketing_system) failed Rule (Reject Direct Marketing) from Policy (demo_privacy_policy)"
       ],
       "message": null
     }
     ```

    Running `fidesctl evaluate demo_resources` now causes an evaluation failure. The privacy policy "Reject Direct Marketing" rule disallows collecting contact information for marketing purposes, and flagged the violating `privacy_declaration` during evaluation.

    </details>

At this point, you've seen some of the core concepts in place: declaring systems, evaluating policies, and re-evaluating policies on every code change. But there's a lot more to discover, so we'd recommend following [the tutorial](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/) to keep learning.
