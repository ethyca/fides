## :zap: Overview

Fides (pronounced */fee-dhez/*, from Latin: FidÄ“s) is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in your code.

## :rocket: Quick Start

### Getting Started

In order to get started quickly with Fides, a sample project is bundled within the Fides CLI that will set up a server, privacy center, and a sample application for you to experiment with.

#### Minimum requirements (for all platforms)

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (version 20.10.11 or later)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 through 3.10)

#### Additional requirements (for ARM Mac Users)

Due to platform differences, the following dependencies and steps are also required:

```bash
brew install freetds openssl
```

**Add the following to your run commands (i.e. `.zshrc`), updating any path/versions to match yours**

```bash
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/freetds/1.3.18/lib -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1u/lib"`
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/freetds/1.3.18/include"
```

#### Download and install Fides

You can easily download and install Fides using `pip`. Run the following command to get started:

```sh
pip install ethyca-fides
```

#### Deploy the Fides sample project

By default, Fides ships with a small project belonging to a fictional e-commerce store. Running the `fides deploy up` command builds a Fides project with all you need to run your first Data Subject Request against real databases.

```sh
fides deploy up
```

#### Explore the sample project

When your deployment finishes, a welcome screen will explain the key components of Fides and the sample "Cookie House" project.

If your browser does not open automatically, you should navigate to <http://localhost:3000/landing>.

The project contains:

* The Fides Admin UI for managing privacy requests
* The Fides [Privacy Center](https://docs.ethyca.com/fides/dsr_quickstart/privacy_center) for submitting requests
* The sample "Cookie House" eCommerce site for testing
* A DSR Directory on your computer to view results (`./fides_uploads`)

#### Run your first Privacy Access Request

Navigate to the Fides Privacy Center (<http://localhost:3001>), submit a "Download your data" request, provide the email address for the sample user (`jane@example.com`), and submit the request.

Then, navigate to the Fides Admin UI (<http://localhost:8080>) to review the pending privacy request.

Use username `root_user` and password `Testpassword1!` to login, approve the request, and review the resulting package in your `./fides_uploads` folder!

### Next Steps

Congratulations! You've just run an entire privacy request in under 5 minutes! Fides offers many more tools help take control of your data privacy. To find out more, you can run a privacy request on [your own infrastructure](https://docs.ethyca.com/fides/dsr_quickstart/overview), discover [data mapping](https://docs.ethyca.com/fides/data_mapping/overview), or learn about the [Fides Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/).
