## :zap: Overview

Fides (*fee-dez*, Latin: FidÄ“s) is the modern framework for data teams to implement data privacy requirements using all your existing CI/CD tools.

- **A Privacy Grammar for engineers.** Fides is a way for you to declare when, where and how you plan to use risky types of data (e.g., personally identifiable information) directly in your code.

- **Privacy Policies that aren't just for lawyers.** Fides allows you to make a privacy policy that's *actually* enforced at time of integration and deployment.

- **CI/CD/CP.** Update your policies and data systems as frequently as you (or your legal team!) needs. The updated policies will continuously evaluate compliance and warn users of unsafe changes _before_ they make it into production.

- **Built to scale.** Lots of databases? Tons of microservices? Large distributed infrastructure? Fides defines the data privacy taxonomy that allows for both lawyers and engineers to work together with a common language, so that the policies and rules can be applied across the entire data ecosystem.

## :bulb: Concepts

Fides has two fundamental parts at its core. The first part is the 4 privacy data types that Fides defines:

The 4 data privacy types are as follows:

- Data Subject - _Whose_ data is it?
- Data Category - _What_ kind of data is it?
- Data Use - _How_ is it being used?
- Data Qualifier - How _identifiable_ is it?

With these privacy data types defined, subsequent resources can now be defined within their scopes. Those subsequent resources comprise the second part of Fides, they are as follows:

- Dataset - Tables and fields described as a combination of Data Categories and Data Qualifiers
- System - Defined as a list of declarations comprising all 4 privacy data types
- Policy - Defined as a list of rules comprising all 4 privacy data types, specifiying which combinations are either permitted or forbidden

Using these primitives, as well as some additional abstractions for syntactic sugar, Fides facilitates comprehensive privacy annotations for entire datascapes.


## :wrench: Installation

### Requirements

Fides requires Python 3.8+. If you're new to Python, we recommend installing the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Latest Release

To install Fides, run:

```bash
pip install fidesctl
```

### Bleeding Edge

For development or just to try out the latest features, you may want to install Fides directly from source.

Please note that the main branch of Fides is not guaranteed to be stable, and is not suitable for production environments.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides.git
pip install -e .
```


## :rocket: Getting Started

We recommend getting started with [our tutorial here](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/), but it's simple to jump right in with 5 easy steps:

1. Install Fides via Docker (you can follow [this guide](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/getting_started/docker/))

1. Create a directory for your Fides resources to live in, like `fides_resources/`.

    ```bash
    mkdir fides_resources/
    ```

1. Let's make our first Policy, you don't even need a lawyer :wink: using our template, modify and add what ever rules you'd like

    <details>
    <summary>Here's an example policy.yaml to get you started</summary>

      ```yaml
    policy:
      - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "primary_privacy_policy"
        name: "Primary Privacy Policy"
        description: "The main privacy policy for our organization."
        rules:
          - organizationId: 1
            fidesKey: "reject_targeted_marketing"
            name: "Reject Targeted Marketing"
            description: "Disallow marketing that is targeted towards users."
            dataCategories:
              inclusion: "ANY"
              values:
                - profiling_data
                - account_data
                - derived_data
                - cloud_service_provider_data
            dataUses:
              inclusion: ANY
              values:
                - market_advertise_or_promote
                - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
            dataSubjects:
              inclusion: ANY
              values:
                - trainee
                - commuter
            dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
            action: REJECT
          - organizationId: 1
            fidesKey: "reject_some_marketing"
            name: "Reject Some Marketing"
            description: "Disallow some marketing that is targeted towards users."
            dataCategories:
              inclusion: ANY
              values:
                - user_location
                - personal_health_data_and_medical_records
                - connectivity_data
                - credentials
            dataUses:
              inclusion: ALL
              values:
                - improvement_of_business_support_for_contracted_service
                - personalize
                - share_when_required_to_provide_the_service
            dataSubjects:
              inclusion: NONE
              values:
                - trainee
                - commuter
                - patient
            dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
            action: REJECT
      ```

    </details>

1. And now, create a System for Fides to check your Policy

    <details>
        <summary>Here's an example system .yaml to get you started</summary>

      ```yaml
    system:
      - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "demo_system"
        name: "Demo System"
        description: "A system used for demos."
        systemType: "Service"
        privacyDeclarations:
          - name: "Analyze Anonymous Content"
            dataCategories:
              - "account_data"
            dataUse: "provide"
            dataQualifier: "anonymized_data"
            dataSubjects:
              - "anonymous_user"
            datasetReferences:
              - "sample_db_dataset.Email"
        systemDependencies:
          - user_service
      ```

    </details>

1. Check your `system` compliance by using `fidesctl evaluate fides_resources/`. This will create all of your defined objects on the server and then run an evaluation. You've now finished a simple Fides workflow!

And ICYMI, we really recommend doing [the tutorial](https://ethyca.github.io/fides/tutorial/). It's helpful to contextualize how you can use Fides in your organization, today!
