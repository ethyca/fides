This includes support for major privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR , CCPA and LGPD ) and standards like ISO 19944 by default. Fides can manage both enforcement of privacy in your CI pipeline and orchestration of data privacy requests in your runtime environment. Why is it called Fides? Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for \"honor and credibility\" in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means \"reliability\": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal . As we considered naming conventions, Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software. If you'd like a brief Roman mythology lesson, check out Fides on Wikipedia . Key Features Privacy as Code You describe your datasets and code using Fides' high-level description language in human-readable, declarative manifest files. This allows you to create a consistent, versioned definition of privacy characteristics in your code to automate reporting, evaluate risk and execute policies against. Automated Privacy Checks Fides integrates with git using the fidesctl tool to allow you to automate privacy checks in your CI pipeline and evalute changes against your privacy policies on each commit. This allows you to review changes and assure they meet your privacy policies before deployment. Support all Privacy Standards Fides ships with a comprehensive taxonomy that allows you to efficiently describe the privacy behaviors of your system for major regulations, including GDPR , CCPA and LGPD as well as major standards like ISO 19944 . Extensible Taxonomy Fides' taxonomy can be easily extended, allowing teams to add support for system specific concepts or data types while inheriting concepts to ensure compliance with global privacy regulations. Automate Privacy Reporting Fides' declarations can be configurd to automatically generate privacy review reports suitable for privacy and legal team review. This allows developers to focus on implementation while providing privacy teams with greater insight into the software's behavior. Data Privacy Rights Automation Fides' data orchestration capabilities mean you can use declarations to generate complex data rights automated processes that execute automatically against user's privacy rights requests. This allows you to easily configure automated, API driven privacy requests for access, erasure and de-identification of data. Next Steps To start learning how Fides works, visit the Tutorial page to walkthrough using the taxonomy, annotating datasets and systems, writing and evaluating policies, and more.

We're a venture-backed privacy technology team headquartered in New York, but working as a distributed team across the US to solve what we believe is the most important problem in technology today: the human right to privacy in vastly complex data-driven systems. What is Fides? Fides is a universally understandable, open-source language that can be used to describe privacy within tech infrastructure. Our existing tools ( Fidesctl and Fidesops ) use this language to power a low friction set of developer tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines, making privacy a feature of your tech stack. With Fides, we hope everyone can build better tools for privacy in the next decade and beyond. What we Believe Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction-filled and complicated. We're building open-source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack. The Future We've been working on this problem since 2018 and have a clear view of our next five years. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it the comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments. This means building solutions for automated privacy analysis, context rich data classification, automated data orchestration for privacy rights, semantic access control models, and more. We'd love you to contribute to Fides and you can do this directly as part of the open-source community. If you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software, join us now and get paid to work on this problem too! Your Participation Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement and an interopable standard for wide adoption.

In order to create a positive and welcoming environment, all interactions are governed by the Fides Code of Conduct . Guidelines Whether it's giving us feedback, raising a question, or showing your Fides-related work, we are looking forward to hearing from you. The Fides community is vibrant because of the quality of its members and the discussions they bring. To keep the workspace inviting and helpful for everyone, there are a few guidelines that we ask all members to follow. Rule 1: Assume Positive Intent Being nice is the most important pillar of the Fides community. We are considerate to each other's effort and time. It's also easy to misinterpret people through Slack, so we make an extra effort to chat in a positive tone. We assume that you are here to learn and exchange ideas, and we ask that you contribute to making a welcoming community. If someone is helping you, be mindful of the effort they are putting in. While we are always happy to help users, we can not help users with step-by-step debugging. Use your professional judgment in discerning whether requests are unreasonable. The Fides team always tries to listen to the community. Please be understanding if your issue or feature request is not deemed an immediate priority. Rule 2: Use threads for larger messages Because of the size of our community and frequency of posts, it's easy for large messages to drown out smaller messages. Using threads helps people see more messages on their screen. Larger code blocks should be posted in threads. Rule 3: Avoid posting sensitive information Community members sometimes need to post code snippets as they ask for help. Be sure to remove sensitive information from posts to the public channels. If your Fides account information is needed to help you, we will ask you to direct message such information. Be cautious of anyone asking for information through direct messages. Rule 4: Write high quality questions The Fides community is here to support you. That said, it is significantly easier to answer well-researched and clearly-written questions. Even adding potentially relevant links to a post helps tremendously. Informative Slack threads are archived by our resident bot Marvin. Having well-written threads helps future users encountering the same problem. Oftentimes your question may have been answered somewhere else; some good resources to start looking before asking a question: Fides Documentation GitHub Issues StackOverflow Rule 5: Don't abuse tagging users Requests for help will be seen by the Fides team, and will be directed to the appropriate person. Tagging individual users is highly discouraged unless it is in the context of a conversation thread. Rule 6: Avoid using DMs to ask for help Fides employees should not be sent questions in DMs unless we specifically ask you to send us private information. There are times when it makes sense to directly message another community member experiencing a similar issue, or working with similar technologies. Just be aware that some people may not want to be messaged. It also helps other people if you post your question publicly. Similar to above, informative Slack threads are archived. Having conversations in public channels drives better quality discussions that can be referenced in the future. Rule 7: Don't advertise material unrelated to Fides Our community is in the channel to learn more about Fides. Showing us Fides-related stuff that you're working on is highly encouraged. Advertising products and events unrelated to Fides will be removed.","title":"Community Hints & Tips"},{"location":"community/hints_tips/#community","text":"The Fides project welcomes issues, contributions and discussion from all users, regardless of background or experience level.

This section of the docs is designed to help you become familiar with how we work, the standards we apply, and how to ensure your contribution is successful. If you're stuck, don't be shy about asking for help on GitHub . Getting Started The first step is to clone the Fidesctl repo for development: 1 git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides Once that's complete, there are a few different ways to spin up the project and get coding! Developer Workflows There are a few different ways to develop Fidesctl, they are listed below in order of how strongly they are recommended! If you're using VS Code, the recommended way to work on Fidesctl is by leveraging the Dev Containers feature. The repo has a .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file already included that will set up a complete environment in VS Code, including the suggested VS Code extensions and settings. Follow these steps to get started: Install the Remote-Containers extension for VS Code. Open the command window (the F1 key will open it, by default) and select the Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container... command. Click \"Open\", without having selected any specific folder. The containers will now spin up and VS Code will be running inside of the containers. The bottom left of the IDE will now say Dev Container: Fidesctl . When you open a new VS Code shell, it will be inside of the fidesctl container, and you'll have access to all of the fidesctl commands as well as any Python commands like pytest , black , mypy , etc. If you're using an editor besides VS Code, then the next best way to work on Fidesctl is by utilizing the Makefile commands: Make sure that you have docker , docker-compose and make installed. Once you have everything set up, run make cli to spin up a shell within the fidesctl container. You can and should run all of your various development commands from within this shell, such as pytest , black , etc. Finally, the least-recommended method would be to install the project in your local environment and develop directly. Write your code We have no doubt you can write amazing code! However, we want to help you ensure your code plays nicely with the rest of the Fidesctl ecosystem. Many projects describe code style and documentation as a suggestion; in Fidesctl it's a CI-checked requirement. To learn how to style your code, see the style guide . To learn how to migrate the database schema, see the database migration guide . To learn how to document your code, see the docs guide . To learn how to test your code, see the tests guide . To learn what format your PR should follow, make sure to follow the pull request guidelines . Submit your code In order to submit code to Fidesctl, please: Fork the Fidesctl repository Create a new branch on your fork Open a Pull Request once your work is ready for review Once automated tests have passed, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved.

There are a few important reasons to write tests: Make sure your code works Tests ensure that your code does the thing you intend it to do. If you have a function that adds two numbers, you'll want to test that it does, in fact, return their sum. If behavior depends on a configuration setting, ensure that changing that setting changes the behavior. In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected. Make sure your code doesn't not work It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken . This is especially important for a project like Fidesctl, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code. For example, you could write tests about what you expect to happen if your function is called with incorrect (or no) arguments, or to ensure that any errors are properly trapped and handled. Tests are documentation Ultimately, your tests are the best documentation for your code. Another developer should be able to look at your tests and understand what your code does, how to invoke it, and what edge cases it contains. Therefore, try to write short, self-explanatory tests with descriptive titles. Help future developers As Fidesctl grows, your code will be reused in more and more places, by developers who may not be familiar with the details of your implementation. Therefore, your tests are an opportunity to ensure that your code is used correctly in the future. For example, if your code needs to be used in a certain way, or expects a certain configuration, or is always expected to return a certain output, or has any other details that might impact its ability to be used in the framework, write a test for it! At minimum, you'll help a future developer understand that you consciously chose to design your code a certain way. Writing tests Fidesctl's tests are stored in the tests directory. Tests should have descriptive names that make it clear what you're testing. If necessary, add a docstring or comment to explain why you're testing this specific thing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Good test name def test_dry_evaluate_system_fail ( server_url , resources_dict ): ... # Bad test name def test_dry_evaluate (): ... Fidesctl has a few pytest fixtures available for testing; see conftest.py for details. Integration tests vs. Mocked tests Generally, tests that include mocking are discouraged. Mocking can create a false sense of security and obfuscate possible errors in the code that only present themselves when integration tested. Running tests Fidesctl uses pytest for unit testing. To run tests, invoke pytest from the /fides/fidesctl/ directory: 1 2 cd fidesctl pytest Running specific tests To run a subset of tests, provide a filename or directory; to match a specific test name, use the -k flag: 1 2 # run all tests in the tests/integration directory that contain the word \"api\" in their title pytest tests/integration/ -k api The --sw flag will exit pytest the first time it encounters an error; subsequent runs with the same flag will skip any tests that succeeded and run the failed test first. For more information on available Pytest invocation options, see the documentation here . Excluding external tests Integration tests also test integration with external services like Snowflake which require internet access and authentication. It is possible to skip these tests by excluding the external mark. 1 2 # run all tests except those marked as external pytest -m \"not external\" CI Workflows CI will run automatically against any PR you open. Please run your tests locally first to avoid \"debugging in CI\", as this takes up resources that could be used by other contributors and is generally an inefficient usage of your time!","title":"Testing"},{"location":"development/testing/#testing","text":"Fidesctl loves tests!

Help future developers As Fidesctl grows, your code will be reused in more and more places, by developers who may not be familiar with the details of your implementation. Therefore, your tests are an opportunity to ensure that your code is used correctly in the future. For example, if your code needs to be used in a certain way, or expects a certain configuration, or is always expected to return a certain output, or has any other details that might impact its ability to be used in the framework, write a test for it! At minimum, you'll help a future developer understand that you consciously chose to design your code a certain way.","title":"Testing"},{"location":"development/testing/#writing-tests","text":"Fidesctl's tests are stored in the tests directory.

You have the Running fidesctl Locally guide where you can see an example of running fidesctl with minimal dependencies and setup. You can use this guide to start fidesctl quickly for local testing and development, however this is only intended to provide inspiration, not to represent a production-grade installation. Where to ask for help For quick and general troubleshooting questions, visit the #troubleshooting channel on the fidesctl Slack. For longer discussions or to share information, visit the GitHub discussions page. If you can provide description of a reproducible problem with the fidesctl software, you can open issue in GitHub issues . Using Production Docker Images More details: Installation from Docker When this option works best This installation method is useful if you are familiar with the container/Docker stack. It provides a capability of running fidesctl components in isolation from other software running on the same physical or virtual machines with easy maintenance of dependencies. The images are built by fidesctl CI/CD pipelines and offer versions for official releases as well as for every commit made to the main branch. For this reason, it is highly discouraged to use the latest tag, as any non-official release versions may contain some instability. Intended users Users who are familiar with containers and Docker stack and understand how to build and extend their own container images. Users who know how to create deployments using Docker by linking together multiple Docker containers and maintaining such deployments. What are you expected to handle You are expected to be able to customize or extend container/Docker images if you want to add extra dependencies. You are expected to put together a deployment built of several containers (for example using docker-compose) and to make sure that they are linked together. You are responsible for setting up the database, automated startup and recovery, maintenance, cleanup and upgrades of fidesctl. You should choose the right deployment mechanism. There a number of available options of deployments of containers. You can use your own custom mechanism, custom Kubernetes deployments, custom Docker Compose, custom Helm charts etc., and you should choose it based on your experience and expectations. What the Fidesctl community provides for this method You have Running Fidesctl in Docker where you can see an example of how to start fidesctl quickly for local testing and development. However this is just an inspiration. Do not expect to use this docker-compose.yml file for production installation, you need to get familiar with Docker Compose and its capabilities and build your own production-ready deployment with it if you choose Docker Compose for your deployment. The Docker Image is managed by the same people who build fidesctl, and they are committed to keeping it updated whenever new features and capabilities of fidesctl are released.

The images are built by fidesctl CI/CD pipelines and offer versions for official releases as well as for every commit made to the main branch. For this reason, it is highly discouraged to use the latest tag, as any non-official release versions may contain some instability. Intended users Users who are familiar with containers and Docker stack and understand how to build and extend their own container images. Users who know how to create deployments using Docker by linking together multiple Docker containers and maintaining such deployments. What are you expected to handle You are expected to be able to customize or extend container/Docker images if you want to add extra dependencies. You are expected to put together a deployment built of several containers (for example using docker-compose) and to make sure that they are linked together. You are responsible for setting up the database, automated startup and recovery, maintenance, cleanup and upgrades of fidesctl. You should choose the right deployment mechanism. There a number of available options of deployments of containers. You can use your own custom mechanism, custom Kubernetes deployments, custom Docker Compose, custom Helm charts etc., and you should choose it based on your experience and expectations. What the Fidesctl community provides for this method You have Running Fidesctl in Docker where you can see an example of how to start fidesctl quickly for local testing and development. However this is just an inspiration. Do not expect to use this docker-compose.yml file for production installation, you need to get familiar with Docker Compose and its capabilities and build your own production-ready deployment with it if you choose Docker Compose for your deployment. The Docker Image is managed by the same people who build fidesctl, and they are committed to keeping it updated whenever new features and capabilities of fidesctl are released.

About the Fides Language The Fides language is based on YAML configuration files. YAML provides a well-understood structure, upon which the Fides language adds helpful primitives which represent types of data, processes or policies. By declaring these primitives with Fides you can describe: what types of data your application process (using Fides data_category annotations) how your system uses that data (using Fides data_use annotations) what policies you want your system to adhere to (using Fides Policy resources) etc. All other language features exist only to make the definition of privacy primitives more flexible and convenient. When fully utilized, these configuration files written using the Fides language tell other Fides tools what your software is doing with data and how to manage the privacy risks of that data process. Software systems are complicated though, so a full Fides configuration will consist of multiple files describing different resources, including: Dataset YAML A Dataset declaration in Fides language represents any location where data is stored: databases, data warehouses, caches and other data storage systems. Within a Fides Dataset, you declare the individual fields (e.g. database columns) where data is located and annotate them to describe the categories of data that are stored. System YAML A System declaration in Fides language represents the privacy properties of a single software project, service, codebase, or application. So the Fides System declaration describes both the categories of data being processed, but also the purposes for which that data is processed.

This page describes the syntax of the language in more detail to help better interpret Fides whether you're authoring or reading. The Fides language is an intentionally simple language designed to be relatively easy for anyone to read and write. The primary objective is to translate complex privacy compliance concepts into a simple syntax, it's for this reason Fides is entirely written as YAML configurations. YAML - Building Block of Fides Fides Taxonomy The Fides language is intentionally simple. To assure this, Fides declarations use predefined primitives (e.g. data categories) that are used when describing your datasets, systems, policies, etc. These predefined primitives exist as part of the Fides taxonomy which is maintained in your fidesctl server so they can be consistently used across your organization's development team. You can learn more about the taxonomy structure and how to extend it in the taxonomy guide . Dot Notation and Snake_Case To make writing and reading Fides language as easy for humans as possible, declarations from the privacy taxonomy use dot notation for the keys and use snake_case compound labels. For example, to describe a field in a database as information provided by a user that is personally identifiable, you can write it's data category as: 1 2 # This declares that the data is provided by the user and identifies them directly user.provided.identifiable If we require greater specificity that just \"identifiable\", we could declare the contact type as a phone number by using a more specific sub-category: 1 2 3 # This declares that the is data provided by the user, # identifies them directly and is from the contact category and of type phone number. user.provided.identifiable.contact.phone_number The diagram below shows you the structure of that statement: notation-conventions Key-Value The key-value is YAML, and Fides', basic building block. Every item in a Fides YAML document is a member of at least one dictionary. The key is always a string . The value is a scalar so that it can be any datatype. So the value can be a string , a number , or another dictionary - most commonly in Fides, this will be a string that may provide a description or a pointer to a reference object in the taxonomy. If we use the example of a user's contact email, to correctly declare this in valid Fides YAML as part of a Dataset, it would be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 fields : # Group of fields in the dataset. - name : email description : User's Email data_categories : # Data category label(s) to assign field. - user.provided.identifiable.contact.email - account.contact.email The key for each key-value pair determines what value types are valid (for example, a resource type such as data_categories must use values from the Data Categories taxonomy), but many keys accept arbitrary strings as descriptive labels. Finally, as you see in the example above, keys such as data_categories accept a list of values for multi-labeling. In this case, the field email has been assigned the value user provided identifiable contact email as well as account related contact email , indicating that it may be either of those categories when used. Character Encoding Fides configuration files must always be UTF-8 encoded.

Summary of Taxonomy Classification Groups 1. Data Categories Data Categories are labels to describe the type of data processed by your software. These are most heavily used by the System and Dataset resources, where you can assign one or more data categories to each field. Data Categories are hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can classify data coarsely with a high-level category (e.g. user.provided data), or you can classify it with greater precision using subcategories (e.g. user.provided.identifiable.contact.email data). Learn more about Data Categories in the taxonomy reference now . 2. Data Uses Data Uses are labels that describe how, or for what purpose(s) a component of your system is using data. Data Uses are also hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can easily describe what you're using data for either coarsely (e.g. provide.system.operations ) or with more precision using subcategories (e.g. provide.system.operations.support.optimization ). Learn more about Data Uses in the taxonomy reference now . 3. Data Subjects Data Subject is a label commonly used in the regulatory world to describe the users of a system who's data is being processed. In many systems a generic user label may be sufficient, however Fides language is intended to provide greater control through specificity where needed. Examples of this are: anonymous_user employee customer patient next_of_kin Learn more about Data Subjects in the taxonomy reference now . 4. Data Qualifiers Data Qualifiers describe the degree of identification of the given data. Think of this as a spectrum: on one end is completely anonymous data, i.e. it is impossible to identify an individual from it, and on the other end is data that specifically identifies an individual. Along this spectrum are labels that describe the degree of identification that a given data might provide, such as: identified anonymized aggregated Learn more about Data Qualifiers in the taxonomy reference now . Extensibility & Interopability The Fides language is designed to support common privacy compliance regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944.

If you'd like something simpler, please see the Running Fidesctl in Docker guide for the recommended setup experience or Running Fidesctl Locally (Standalone) for the simplest possible installation. System Requirements See the Prerequisites and Dependencies page for more information. Fidesctl installation The next step is to install fidesctl via pip with the required extras: 1 pip install \"fidesctl[webserver]\" For more information on pip installing fidesctl as well as the other potential extras, see the Installation from PyPI guide. Database installation Due to environmental differences, there is no specific guide on running/configuring your own Postgres database outside of the version constraints mentioned in the System Requirements section above. Make sure to note your database credentials and use them to generate a SQLAlchemy Connection String . This will be used in the database_url configuration value mentioned below. Configuring Fidesctl See our Configuration guide for more information on how to configure fidesctl. Running the webserver Now that we've spun up our database and set our configuration values, it's time to start our webserver. In a shell, run the following command: 1 fidesctl webserver The fidesctl webserver will now be accessible at localhost:8080 , you can test this by going to localhost:8080/health and localhost:8080/docs . Using the CLI Now that the database and webserver are running, it's time to verify that the whole installation is working properly. Run the command fidesctl ping to make sure that the CLI can talk to the webserver. The output should look something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Pinging http://fidesctl:8080/health... { \"data\": { \"message\": \"Fidesctl API service is healthy!\" } } Next is to verify that the database is reachable from the webserver. Run the command fidesctl ls organizations to verify that all is working. The output should look something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [ { \"fides_key\" : \"default_organization\" , \"organization_fides_key\" : \"default_organization\" , \"name\" : null , \"description\" : null , \"organization_parent_key\" : null } ] That's it!

Note: In a production app this directory can have any name, but it's a best practice to create a specific directory to house the fidesctl manifest files. Fundamentally, the data ecosystem is built on data that is stored somewhere . In fidesctl, Datasets are used for granular, field-level annotations of exactly what data your systems are storing and where that data is stored. For example, an app might declare one dataset for a Postgres application database, a second dataset for a Mongo orders collection, and a third dataset for some CSV files in cloud storage. The Dataset resource provides a database-agnostic way to annotate the fields stored in these systems with Data Categories, providing a metadata layer consumable by other tooling.

The language is built on declaring the types of data found in storage for your organization. In traditional SQL, fidesctl defines the following: \"datasets\" as database schemas \"collections\" as database tables \"fields\" as database columns For NoSQL datasets, fidesctl defines the following: \"dataset\" \"collection\" as a logical grouping of data fields (ie: in MongoDB, this is called a \"Collection\") \"fields\" as a reference to an individual data element (ie: in MongoDB, this is called a \"field\") Additionally, fideslang has attributes that describe what kind of data is contained in this dataset. We use the following attributes to describe the data: Name Type Description name String The name of this field description String A description of what this field contains data_categories List[FidesKey] The types of sensitive data, as defined by the taxonomy, that can be found in this field data_qualifier FidesKey The level of deidentification for the dataset For more detail on Dataset resources, see the full Dataset resource documentation . PRO TIP As you're progressing with the tutorial, we recommend installing our fidesctl VS Code extension , which will validate the syntax in real-time as you're writing your resource files! Maintaining a Dataset Resource As apps add more databases and other services to store potentially sensitive data, it is recommended that updating this resource file becomes a part of the development process when building a new feature. Next: Annotate the System Resource With the underlying database resource declared, you must now include the database in an application-level System resource annotation .","title":"Annotate the Dataset"},{"location":"tutorial/dataset/#annotate-the-dataset","text":"Making the fidesctl tools available within the app's virtual environment is just the beginning.

For this project, the file should contain the following configuration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 system : - fides_key : flaskr_system name : Flaskr Web Application description : An example Flask web app that simulates an e-commerce application system_type : Application privacy_declarations : - name : Provide e-commerce operations to example customers data_categories : - user.provided.identifiable - user.derived.identifiable - system.operations data_use : provide.system.operations data_subjects : - customer data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified dataset_references : - flaskr_postgres_dataset Privacy Declarations can be read colloquially as \"This system uses sensitive data types of data_categories for data_subjects with the purpose of data_use at a deidentification level of data_qualifier \".
