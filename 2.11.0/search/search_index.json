We're a venture-backed privacy technology team headquartered in New York, but working as a distributed team across the US to solve what we believe is the most important problem in technology today: the human right to privacy in vastly complex data-driven systems. What is Fides? Fides is a universally understandable, open-source language that can be used to describe privacy within tech infrastructure. Our existing tools use this language to power a low friction set of developer tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines, making privacy a feature of your tech stack. With Fides, we hope everyone can build better tools for privacy in the next decade and beyond. What we Believe Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction-filled and complicated. We're building open-source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack. The Future We've been working on this problem since 2018 and have a clear view of our next five years. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it the comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments. We'd love you to contribute to Fides, and you can do this directly as part of the open-source community. If you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software, join us now and get paid to work on this problem too! Your Participation Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement, and held as an interoperable standard for wide adoption. Your feedback, contributions, and improvements are encouraged as we build community with the sole objective of creating respectful software for everyone on the internet.","title":"About Ethyca"},{"location":"ethyca/#about-ethyca","text":"The mission of Ethyca is to make Internet-scale technology respectful and ethical.

In order to create a positive and welcoming environment, all interactions are governed by the Fides Code of Conduct . Guidelines Whether it's giving us feedback, raising a question, or showing your Fides-related work, we are looking forward to hearing from you. The Fides community is vibrant because of the quality of its members and the discussions they bring. To keep the workspace inviting and helpful for everyone, there are a few guidelines that we ask all members to follow. Rule 1: Assume Positive Intent Being nice is the most important pillar of the Fides community. We are considerate to each other's effort and time. It's also easy to misinterpret people through Slack, so we make an extra effort to chat in a positive tone. We assume that you are here to learn and exchange ideas, and we ask that you contribute to making a welcoming community. If someone is helping you, be mindful of the effort they are putting in. While we are always happy to help users, we can not help users with step-by-step debugging. Use your professional judgment in discerning whether requests are unreasonable. The Fides team always tries to listen to the community. Please be understanding if your issue or feature request is not deemed an immediate priority. Rule 2: Use threads for larger messages Because of the size of our community and frequency of posts, it's easy for large messages to drown out smaller messages. Using threads helps people see more messages on their screen. Larger code blocks should be posted in threads. Rule 3: Avoid posting sensitive information Community members sometimes need to post code snippets as they ask for help. Be sure to remove sensitive information from posts to the public channels. If your Fides account information is needed to help you, we will ask you to direct message such information. Be cautious of anyone asking for information through direct messages. Rule 4: Write high quality questions The Fides community is here to support you. That said, it is significantly easier to answer well-researched and clearly-written questions. Even adding potentially relevant links to a post helps tremendously. Informative Slack threads are archived by our resident bot Marvin. Having well-written threads helps future users encountering the same problem. Oftentimes your question may have been answered somewhere else; some good resources to start looking before asking a question: Fides Documentation GitHub Issues StackOverflow Rule 5: Don't abuse tagging users Requests for help will be seen by the Fides team, and will be directed to the appropriate person. Tagging individual users is highly discouraged unless it is in the context of a conversation thread. Rule 6: Avoid using DMs to ask for help Fides employees should not be sent questions in DMs unless we specifically ask you to send us private information. There are times when it makes sense to directly message another community member experiencing a similar issue, or working with similar technologies. Just be aware that some people may not want to be messaged. It also helps other people if you post your question publicly. Similar to above, informative Slack threads are archived. Having conversations in public channels drives better quality discussions that can be referenced in the future. Rule 7: Don't advertise material unrelated to Fides Our community is in the channel to learn more about Fides. Showing us Fides-related stuff that you're working on is highly encouraged. Advertising products and events unrelated to Fides will be removed.","title":"Community Hints and Tips"},{"location":"community/hints_tips/#community","text":"The Fides project welcomes issues, contributions and discussion from all users, regardless of background or experience level.

Both methods can be used simultaneously, with environment variables taking precedence over the toml file values. Using a Configuration File Fides will use the first config file it can read from the following locations. Listed in order of precedence they are: At the path specified using the config file argument passed through the CLI, i.e. fides -f <config_path> At the path specified by the FIDES__CONFIG_PATH environment variable In the current working directory it will check for a subdir .fides and a file within named fides.toml , i.e. ./.fides/fides.toml Generating a Config File If you'd like to generate a new config file automatically using default values, run fides init . This will create the file at the default location of ./.fides/fides.toml Setting Values Via Environment Variables Fides follows a set pattern for configuration via environment variables. It looks for environment variables that start with FIDES followed by the config subsection name, followed by the key name, all separated with double underscores. In practice this would look like FIDES__<SUBSECTION>__<KEY> As a toml configuration value: 1 2 [database] host = config_example As an environment variable: 1 EXPORT FIDES__DATABASE__HOST = config_example Viewing your configuration You can view the current configuration of your application via either the CLI or API. CLI To view your application configuration via the CLI, run: 1 fides view config This will show all configuration variables, including sensitive ones. It is printed to the console as valid toml , so this can be copy/pasted as needed. API To view your application configuration in the API, run: 1 GET /api/v1/config For security reasons, sensitive configuration values will not be shown here. Special Sections There are a few \"special\" configuration sections that behave in unique ways compared to the other sections. These sections will be addressed in the following documentation. Celery Fides uses Celery for asynchronous task management. To simplify deployments and remove the need for two different toml configuration files, it is possible to configure Celery via the Fides configuration file. Any valid configuration key/value pair for Celery can instead be added to the Fides toml configuration file and will automatically be passed through to the Celery deployment. Note that Fides will not validate any of these key/value pairs. See the above configuration file reference for an example of using celery configuration pass-through. For a full list of possible variable overrides, see the Celery configuration documentation . Example Celery Section 1 2 3 4 [celery] event_queue_prefix = \"fides_worker\" task_default_queue = \"fides\" task_always_eager = true Credentials The credentials section uses custom keys which can be referenced in specific commands that take the --credentials-id option. For example, a command that uses a credential might look like fides scan dataset db --credentials-id app_postgres . The credential object itself will be validated at the time of use depending on what type of credential is required. For instance if fides scan system okta is used, it will expect the object to contain orgUrl and token key/value pairs. In the case of a typical database like postgres, it will only expect a connection_string. The following is an example of what a credentials section might look like in a given deployment with various applications: Example Credentials Section 1 2 [credentials] app_postgres = { connection_string = \"postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:fides@fides-db:5432/fides\" } Configuration File Reference This following file is an autogenerated configuration reference file.

Follow the Using Postman guide to learn more about the how to use the collection. API URLs We define API URLs for specific API versions as constants within fides.api.ops.api.v1.urn_registry (where v1 can be substituted for that particular API version), then import those URLs into their specific API views. Since we are on the first version, there is no clear precedent set for overriding URLs between versions yet. The most likely change is that we'll override the APIRouter class instantiation with a different base path (ie. /api/v2 instead of /api/v1 ). For example: 1 2 PRIVACY_REQUEST = \"/privacy-request\" PRIVACY_REQUEST_DETAIL = \"/privacy-request/{privacy_request_id}\" would both resolve as /api/v1/privacy-request and /api/v1/privacy-request/{privacy_request_id} respectively. Database and Models The ORM -- SQLAlchemy SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper, allowing us to avoid writing direct database queries within our codebase, and access the database via Python code instead. The ORM provides an additional configuration layer allowing user-defined Python classes to be mapped to database tables and other constructs, as well as an object persistence mechanism known as the Session . Some common uses cases are listed below, for a more comprehensive guide see: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/index.html Adding models Database tables are defined with model classes. Model files should live in src/app/models/ . Individual model classes must inherit from our custom base class at app.db.base_class.Base to ensure uniformity within the database. Multiple models per file are encouraged so long as they fit the same logical delineation within the project. An example model declaration is added below. For a comprehensive guide see: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/mapping_styles.html#declarative-mapping You should also import your model in src/fides/api/ops/db/base.py so it is visible for alembic. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 class Book(Base): __tablename__ = 'book' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) name = Column(String, index=True) page_count = Column(Integer, nullable=True) author_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\"author.id\"), nullable=False) When models are added to the project, we must then add them to the database in a recordable and repeatable fashion using migrations. Using the database via models Once you've added database tables via project models, you're ready to read, write, and update them via Python code. Some examples of common use cases here are listed below. Official documentation is here: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Query . Import our application's database session: from fides.api.ops.db.session import get_db_session Instantiate the database interaction object: 1 2 SessionLocal = get_db_session(config) db = SessionLocal() Create a new row in a table: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 db_obj = User( email=\"admin@fides.app\", full_name=\"Fides Admin\", is_superuser=True, is_active=True, ) db.add(db_obj) db.commit() db.refresh(db_obj) Fetch all objects in a table: users = db.query(User).all() Fetch all objects in a table that meet some criteria: active_users = db.query(User).filter(User.is_active == True) Get a specific row in a table: user = db.query(User).get(User.email == \"admin@fides.app\") Update a specific row in a table: 1 2 3 4 user.email = \"updated@fides.app\" db.add(user) db.commit() db.refresh() Connecting to the database When you run nox -s dev , the database will spin up in a Docker container with port 5432 exposed on localhost. You can connect to it using the credentials found in .fides.toml , e.g. Hostname: localhost Port: 5432 Username: see database.user in .fides.toml Password: see database.password in .fides.toml Alembic migrations Some common Alembic commands are listed below. For a comprehensive guide see: https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html . The commands will need to be run inside a shell on your Docker containers, which can be opened with nox -s dev -- shell . In the /src/fides/api/ctl directory: Migrate your database to the latest state: alembic upgrade head Get revision id of previous migration: alembic current Automatically generate a new migration: alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"<a message describing your changes>\" Create a new migration file to manually fill out: alembic revision -m \"<a message describing your changes>\" Migrate your database to a specific state alembic upgrade <revision-id> or alembic downgrade <revision-id> , (or if you want to be smart alembic upgrade <revision-id> || alembic downgrade <revision-id> is handy when you don't know whether the target revision is an upgrade or downgrade) NB.

This section of the docs is designed to help you become familiar with how we work, the standards we apply, and how to ensure your contribution is successful. If you're stuck, don't be shy about asking for help on GitHub . Getting Started The first step is to clone the Fides repo for development: 1 git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides Once that's complete, there are a few different ways to spin up the project and get coding! Developer Workflows There are a few different ways to develop Fides, they are listed below in order of how strongly they are recommended! The recommended way to work on Fides is by utilizing the Noxfile commands: Make sure that you have docker and nox ( pip install nox ) installed. Run nox in the root directory to see a list of all of the possible Nox commands. This is helpful as a reference when trying to find new commands or remember old ones! Run nox -s dev -- shell to spin up the entire fides application as well as a shell within the fides webserver container. You can and should run all of your various development commands from within this shell, such as pytest , black , etc. While it is possible to install all application dependencies and develop on the project without Docker, this is neither recommended nor tested. NOTE : When working with the CLI or ctl tests via an interactive shell, you will most likely need to authenticate with fides user login . Check the development fides.toml file for the root credentials. Issues MSSQL: Known issues around connecting to MSSQL exist today for Apple M1 users. M1 users that wish to install pyodbc locally, please reference the workaround here . Package not found: When running nox -s dev , if you get a importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError: fides , do nox -s dev -- shell , and then run pip install -e . . Verify Fides is installed with pip list . Write your code We have no doubt you can write amazing code! However, we want to help you ensure your code plays nicely with the rest of the Fides ecosystem. Many projects describe code style and documentation as a suggestion; in Fides it's a CI-checked requirement. To learn how to style your code, see the style guide . To learn how to migrate the database schema, see the database migration guide . To learn how to document your code, see the docs guide . To learn how to test your code, see the tests guide . To learn what format your PR should follow, make sure to follow the pull request guidelines . Submit your code In order to submit code to Fides, please: Fork the Fides repository Create a new branch on your fork Open a Pull Request once your work is ready for review Once automated tests have passed, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved.

Due to the rapid development of the project, some minor versions may also contain minor breaking changes. The best practice is to always pin versions, and carefully test before bumping to a new version. Patch versions will never cause breaking changes, and are only used to hotfix critical bugs. Release schedule Fides does not follow a set release schedule, and instead ships versions based on the addition of features and functionality. Each release, with the exception of hotfixes, will contain at least one substantial new feature. Planning For each release, a corresponding GitHub Project is created. Issues are added to projects as a way to organize what will be included in each release. Once a release project is complete and the core team signs off on the readiness of the release, a new version is cut using GitHub releases. You can see all Fides releases here . Each new release triggers a GitHub Action that pushes the new version to PyPI, and a clean version to DockerHub. The release project is then marked as closed . Hotfixes are an exception to this, and can be added and pushed as patch versions when needed. Branching Fides uses continuous delivery with a single main branch. All code changes are merged into this branch. When releasing, a new tag is created, and the release process proceeds automatically. In the case of patches, a branch is created from the relevant tag. Commits are then cherry-picked into this branch, and a new patch version tag is created. Release Steps We use GitHub\u2019s release feature to tag releases that then get automatically deployed to DockerHub and PyPi via GitHub Actions pipelines. We also use a CHANGELOG.md to make sure that our users are never surprised about an upcoming change and can plan upgrades accordingly. The release steps are as follows: Major and Minor Open a PR that is titled the version of the release (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Rename the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md to the new version number and put a date next to it Update the compare links for both the new version and for the new Unreleased section Once approved, merge the PR Create a new release, ensuring that the last PR to get merged is the aforementioned CHANGELOG.md update PR Add the new version as the tag (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Make the title the version with a v in front of it (i.e. v1.6.0 ) Add a link to the CHANGELOG.md Auto-populate the release notes Publish the release Patch It may be necessary for a patch release to contain only select commits to the main branch since the last major or minor release. To create a release with only the desired changes, follow the steps below: Checkout the most recent release's tag To fetch the most recent tag's name, run: 1 2 3 4 # fides on main git describe --abbrev = 0 --tags #=> 1.2.3 To checkout the most recent tag, run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 #fides on main git checkout 1 .2.3 #=> Note: switching to '1.2.3'. # # You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental # changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this # state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. # # If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may # do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command.

There are a few important reasons to write tests: Make sure your code works Tests ensure that your code does the thing you intend it to do. If you have a function that adds two numbers, you'll want to test that it does, in fact, return their sum. If behavior depends on a configuration setting, ensure that changing that setting changes the behavior. In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected. Make sure your code doesn't not work It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken . This is especially important for a project like Fides, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code. For example, you could write tests about what you expect to happen if your function is called with incorrect (or no) arguments, or to ensure that any errors are properly trapped and handled. Tests are documentation Ultimately, your tests are the best documentation for your code.

The general approach is to allow the local fides Docker Compose service to allow remote debugging connections, and to start a remote debugger from a host VSCode workspace. Setup Run Fides with Remote Debugging Enabled In order to accept incoming remote debugging connections, the fides Docker Compose service must be run with slight alterations. To enable this functionality, simply add the remote_debug flag to a nox command. For example: 1 nox -s dev -- remote_debug or 1 nox -s dev -- remote_debug postgres timescale With those commands, the fides Docker Compose service that's running the Fides server locally is able to accept incoming remote debugging connections. Note that, at this point, the remote_debug flag is not enabled for other nox sessions, e.g. fides_env , pytest_ops , etc. Attach a Remote Debugger to the Fides Server Now that the running Fides server can accept incoming remote debugging connections, you can attach a remote debugger from a local VSCode workspace to actively debug the server application. A launch configuration is included in the fides repo to facilitate this step. Open up the fides repo in a VSCode workspace Go to the Run and Debug view From the debugger dropdown list, select the Python debugger: Remote Attach Fides configuration Click the Start Debugging play button The remote debugger should now be attached to the Fides server! To confirm the debugger is attached, at least one RUNNING line item should appear in the CALL STACK window Debug! At this point, VSCode is ready to debug the running Fides server. Try setting breakpoints and hitting them by, e.g., making certain HTTP requests against the Fides server. This guide provides more information on how to use the VSCode Python debugger.

Loading the collection Get Postman Postman > File > Import Upload the Fides collection found in docs/fides/docs/postman/Fides.postman_collection.json Click on the imported fidesops collection in the left pane, and then find Variables to edit the fidesops collection variables. Some variables are populated for you, and some will be added in this guide's next steps. Add your oauth_root_client_id and oauth_root_client_secret under CURRENT VALUE . fidesadmin and fidesadminsecret are default configurations for testing, found in your fides.toml . Add the appropriate values for your instance if they differ. Important: Click Save ! Bring up local servers and mock databases Run nox -s dev -- <datastore> in your terminal. This brings up the Fides server and the list of datastores specified, i.e. nox -s dev -- postgres mongodb . These mock datastores are pre-populated with test data to represent your datastores. The following list of requests is kept in the Minimum API calls to create an Access Privacy Request folder. Some of the returned data will need to be saved as additional variables for use in other steps. Saving Authentication variables Click on the Get Root Client Token request, and click Send to send a POST request to Fides to create a root token. Copy the access_token returned in the response body, and paste it as the Current Value of root_client_token in Fides' variables. Important: Click Save ! Similarly, click on Create Client , and click Send to send a POST request to Fides to create a new client. Copy the client_id and client_secret and paste into Current Value slots in Fides variables and click \"Save\". Finally, click on the Get Client Token request, and click Send to send another POST request to Fides. This will create a token for the client made in the previous step. If you click on Body , you can see that the client_id and client_secret have been added as form data for you. Save the returned token under client_token in the Fides variables. The client_token will be automatically passed into the rest of your requests as the Bearer Token. Building out remaining privacy request configuration Run through the remaining requests in the Minimum API calls to create an Access Privacy Request folder. Because variables are automatically being populated for you, you should be able to click on each request, clicking Send for each one. Inspect the Body of each request to see what is sent to Fides: Specify where your data is going: SEND Create/Update Storage - Local Storage Config - Sets up a local folder for uploading your privacy request results (local testing only) Configure what data you care about, and what to do with it: SEND Create/Update Policies - Creates a Policy to handle Privacy Requests SEND Create/Update Access Rule - Defines an access Rule on the previous Policy, which specifies results will be uploaded to the configured local storage SEND Create/Update Rule Targets - Specify a RuleTarget that says to will return data that has been marked as having a user data category Create ConnectionConfigs, and add connection secrets for the postgres_example and mongodb_example mock databases: SEND Create/Update Connection Configs: Postgres SEND Create/Update Connection Configs: Mongo SEND Update Connection Secrets: Postgres SEND Update Connection Secrets: Mongo Add annotations of the Postgres and Mongo datastores: SEND Create/Update Postgres Dataset SEND Create/Update Dataset Mongo API calls to additional supported datastores (MsSQL, MySQL) are in separate folders within the collection. Run a privacy request You have now completed the basic configuration required to create an Access Request. SEND Create Access Privacy Requests If \"succeeded\", note the \"id\" that is returned. Succeeded means the privacy request has been created and is pending, not that its execution is complete. Check your local fides_uploads folder, configured earlier, to see access request results. This is run asynchronously, so it may take a few moments to complete. This particular request should have retrieved data from both the postgres_example and mongodb_example databases with the user data_category Next steps Check out other requests in the collection! The Calls to create an Erasure Request folder walks you through configuring a separate erasure policy, and executing an erasure request.
