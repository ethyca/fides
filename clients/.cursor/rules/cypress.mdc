# Running Cypress from agent/automated environments

When running Cypress (e.g. `npm run cy:run` or `npx cypress run`) from an environment where **ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE** is set (e.g. Cursor's agent), Cypress will fail with "bad option" errors during verification.

**Fix:** Unset that variable before invoking Cypress:

```bash
env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npx cypress run
# or for a single spec:
env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/fides-js/consent-notices.cy.ts"
```

From the privacy-center directory:

```bash
cd clients/privacy-center
env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm run cy:run
```
