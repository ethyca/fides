                A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to
                environmentally conscious users living in the city after office
                hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related
                content (such as an article on climate change actions) after
                6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they
                are in an urban zone.
