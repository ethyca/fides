# Fides Sample App

"Cookie House", a sample web application to help demonstrate some of the features of Fides!

## Configuration

## Development

To run locally, follow these steps:

In `/clients/sample-app`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will automatically bring up a Docker Compose project to create a sample app database containing the Cookie House products data, so ensure you also have `docker` running locally.

Once running successfully, open http://localhost:3000 to see the Cookie House!

## Pre-commit

Before committing any changes, run the following:

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run test
```

## Testing

This app (currently!) does not have any automated tests. However, it is used in the following automated E2E suites:

- `clients/cypress-e2e/cypress/e2e`
- `clients/privacy-center/cypress/e2e`

These Cypress suites will automatically run in CI to ensure any changes to this app continue to work as expected.

## Deployment

To deploy this app, typically you should use the published `ethyca/fides-sample-app` Docker image which is production-built Next.js image. See https://docs.ethyca.com for more!
