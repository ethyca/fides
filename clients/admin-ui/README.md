# Admin UI

Admin UI for managing Fides privacy requests. A web application built in Next.js with the FidesUI component library.

## Running Locally

1. In a new shell, `cd` into `clients/admin-ui`, then run `turbo run dev`.
1. Nav to `http://localhost:3000/` and log in using the created user. The `email` field is simply the `user` that was created, not a valid email address.

## Unit test locations

Unless otherwise specified below, all unit tests should be colocated in the directory with the file(s) they are testing, in a `__tests__` subfolder.

The sole exception to this is the `pages` directory. Tests for Next.js pages live in the root `__tests__/pages` directory. Otherwise, Next.js attempts to include them in final build output, which breaks the build.

## Feature flags

During the software development process, one or more features may not be visible at runtime. Feature flags are defined
within [flags.json](./src/flags.json).

You can toggle flags at runtime by opening the features panel, which can be accessed under the user menu in the top-right
of the page header. These changes will be saved per-browser, per-environment, until you log out or reset them from the menu.

### Environments

Feature flags can be configured independently for the development, test, and production environments:

- **development** - Running `turbo run dev` uses the development environment. This will include bleeding-edge features.
- **test** - Cypress runs in the tet environment via `turbo run cy:start`. This will usually match production, but
  new features may be enabled in test to verify them in CI before release.
- **production** - Only features ready for release will be enabled for production. `turbo run build` always produces a
  build configured for production, which is then bundled into the Fides server.

You can switch between these environments manually by overriding the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` environment variable when
running the app, for example:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production turbo run dev`

Or you can configure the environment using `env.local` as described by the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#loading-environment-variables).

In addition, you can mark a flag as `userCannotModify: true` in `flags.json`. This will prevent the user from seeing that flag as an override-able option in the Beta Features section. However, the values given to the various environments will still be in effect. Therefore, you can still control the flag with the same level of granularity via the `flags.json` file, but not via the UI.

## Preparing for production

To view a production version of this site, including the backend:

1. Run `turbo prod-export`. This will
   1. Export the static site to `out/`
   1. Copy the build from `out/` to the folder in the backend which will serve static assets at `/`
1. Run `nox -s api` in the top-level `fides` directory.
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
