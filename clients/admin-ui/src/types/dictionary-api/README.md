# Fides Compass API Types

**Do not manually edit these files.**

The TypeScript files in this directory are auto-generated by OpenAPI. We do the same thing for our Fides backend types, but this is the equivalent for the dictionary service. Refer to [the Fides API types README](../api/README.md) for more information.

## Updating

These files can by regenerated by running:

```
turbo run openapi:generate-dictionary
```

**A local compass instance must be running on `localhost:8081`**. This will read the schema hosted at <http://localhost:8081/docs> and generate all TS files under `clients/admin-ui/src/types/dictionary-api/`.
