      Websites, or “properties”, often process user data. Adding a website as an
      integration lets you configure a Consent Management Platform (CMP), a
      site-specific privacy center, and Cross-Origin requests via Fides. You can
      also set up monitors to detect vendors, track technologies like cookies or
      pixels, and ensure compliance.
