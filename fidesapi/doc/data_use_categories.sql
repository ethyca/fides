Provide can include the use of specified data categories to protect the rights and property of the cloud service provider and to prevent loss of life or serious injury to anyone. For example:
Example 1:
This cloud service uses derived data only to provide the cloud services defined in the cloud services agreement.
NOTE 1 In this example, use of derived data is restricted to provide the service contracted for in the cloud service agreement, including operational support system (OSS) and business support system (BSS) for exclusively those services. In the case of a single contracted service, “This application” or “This service” can also define the scope (see 9.4.2.3).
NOTE 2 The data use statement structure used in this example is described in Clause 10.

The same changes may apply to multiple users, for example all users of a particular customer or all of the users sharing common characteristics may receive the same changes.
Personalize can be used with a single scope, in which case data acquired or created by applications and services in the provided scope is used to change the presentation of the capabilities of that scope or to change the selection and presentation of content by the applications and services in the scope to be specific to a user.
Example 2:
Customer content data from this service is used to personalize cloud service provider’s services outside of the services listed in the cloud service agreement.
Example 2 describes personalizing of services unrelated to the contracted service based on usage of customer data regarding the contracted service to improve services that are not contracted by the customer. Since data on service usage provide information on the preferences of the cloud service user, their collection and correlation with other data sources can be used to trigger, maintain and improve a large variety of supplementary services. This includes use of other services, not explicitly contracted by user, as listed in the following examples.
— The usage of location data from mobile devices to provide location-based services to the user according to his or her past behaviour.
— Add-on advertisement services based on search engine queries, combined with data on past user behaviour.

Example 3:
This service shares customer content data with third parties.
This example is a poor use statement in that it does not provide clarity of the purpose for which the data are being shared nor of the extent of the data being shared. CSPs are strongly encouraged to provide as much detail as possible in data use statements so that it is clear to the CSC what is being done with which data.
NOTE 1 The data use statement structure used in this example is described in Clause 10.
Cloud service providers should specify a purpose for sharing data by including a use definition. Example 4:
This service shares payment instrument data with third-party partners and data processors to provide the cloud service.
This example adds some clarity to how retail services provide payment instrument data (i.e. credit card information) to third parties, for example for billing purposes, for the specific purpose of providing the service.
NOTE 2 The data use statement structure used in this example is described in Clause 10.
Cloud service providers should use scope characteristics (see 9.4.3) for the source scope and for the
receiving entity or result scope to further specify the sharing.
Cloud service providers should include a description of the network connection between scopes (see
9.4.4) following the statement structure described in data sharing (see 10.2.9).");
