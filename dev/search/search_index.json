We're a venture-backed privacy technology team headquartered in New York, but working as a distributed team across the US to solve what we believe is the most important problem in technology today: the human right to privacy in vastly complex data-driven systems. What is Fides? Fides is a universally understandable, open-source language that can be used to describe privacy within tech infrastructure. Our existing tools use this language to power a low friction set of developer tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines, making privacy a feature of your tech stack. With Fides, we hope everyone can build better tools for privacy in the next decade and beyond. What we Believe Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction-filled and complicated. We're building open-source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack. The Future We've been working on this problem since 2018 and have a clear view of our next five years. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it the comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments. We'd love you to contribute to Fides, and you can do this directly as part of the open-source community. If you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software, join us now and get paid to work on this problem too! Your Participation Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement, and held as an interoperable standard for wide adoption. Your feedback, contributions, and improvements are encouraged as we build community with the sole objective of creating respectful software for everyone on the internet.","title":"About Ethyca"},{"location":"ethyca/#about-ethyca","text":"The mission of Ethyca is to make Internet-scale technology respectful and ethical.

In order to create a positive and welcoming environment, all interactions are governed by the Fides Code of Conduct . Guidelines Whether it's giving us feedback, raising a question, or showing your Fides-related work, we are looking forward to hearing from you. The Fides community is vibrant because of the quality of its members and the discussions they bring. To keep the workspace inviting and helpful for everyone, there are a few guidelines that we ask all members to follow. Rule 1: Assume Positive Intent Being nice is the most important pillar of the Fides community. We are considerate to each other's effort and time. It's also easy to misinterpret people through Slack, so we make an extra effort to chat in a positive tone. We assume that you are here to learn and exchange ideas, and we ask that you contribute to making a welcoming community. If someone is helping you, be mindful of the effort they are putting in. While we are always happy to help users, we can not help users with step-by-step debugging. Use your professional judgment in discerning whether requests are unreasonable. The Fides team always tries to listen to the community. Please be understanding if your issue or feature request is not deemed an immediate priority. Rule 2: Use threads for larger messages Because of the size of our community and frequency of posts, it's easy for large messages to drown out smaller messages. Using threads helps people see more messages on their screen. Larger code blocks should be posted in threads. Rule 3: Avoid posting sensitive information Community members sometimes need to post code snippets as they ask for help. Be sure to remove sensitive information from posts to the public channels. If your Fides account information is needed to help you, we will ask you to direct message such information. Be cautious of anyone asking for information through direct messages. Rule 4: Write high quality questions The Fides community is here to support you. That said, it is significantly easier to answer well-researched and clearly-written questions. Even adding potentially relevant links to a post helps tremendously. Informative Slack threads are archived by our resident bot Marvin. Having well-written threads helps future users encountering the same problem. Oftentimes your question may have been answered somewhere else; some good resources to start looking before asking a question: Fides Documentation GitHub Issues StackOverflow Rule 5: Don't abuse tagging users Requests for help will be seen by the Fides team, and will be directed to the appropriate person. Tagging individual users is highly discouraged unless it is in the context of a conversation thread. Rule 6: Avoid using DMs to ask for help Fides employees should not be sent questions in DMs unless we specifically ask you to send us private information. There are times when it makes sense to directly message another community member experiencing a similar issue, or working with similar technologies. Just be aware that some people may not want to be messaged. It also helps other people if you post your question publicly. Similar to above, informative Slack threads are archived. Having conversations in public channels drives better quality discussions that can be referenced in the future. Rule 7: Don't advertise material unrelated to Fides Our community is in the channel to learn more about Fides. Showing us Fides-related stuff that you're working on is highly encouraged. Advertising products and events unrelated to Fides will be removed.","title":"Community Hints and Tips"},{"location":"community/hints_tips/#community","text":"The Fides project welcomes issues, contributions and discussion from all users, regardless of background or experience level.

Both methods can be used simultaneously, with environment variables taking precedence over the toml file values. Using a Configuration File Fides will use the first config file it can read from the following locations. Listed in order of precedence they are: At the path specified using the config file argument passed through the CLI, i.e. fides -f <config_path> At the path specified by the FIDES__CONFIG_PATH environment variable In the current working directory it will check for a subdir .fides and a file within named fides.toml , i.e. ./.fides/fides.toml Generating a Config File If you'd like to generate a new config file automatically using default values, run fides init . This will create the file at the default location of ./.fides/fides.toml Setting Values Via Environment Variables Fides follows a set pattern for configuration via environment variables. It looks for environment variables that start with FIDES followed by the config subsection name, followed by the key name, all separated with double underscores. In practice this would look like FIDES__<SUBSECTION>__<KEY> As a toml configuration value: 1 2 [database] host = config _ example As an environment variable: 1 EXPORT FIDES__DATABASE__HOST = config_example Viewing your configuration You can view the current configuration of your application via either the CLI or API. CLI To view your application configuration via the CLI, run: 1 fides view config This will show all configuration variables, including sensitive ones. It is printed to the console as valid toml , so this can be copy/pasted as needed. API To view your application configuration in the API, run: 1 GET /api/v1/config For security reasons, sensitive configuration values will not be shown here. Special Sections There are a few \"special\" configuration sections that behave in unique ways compared to the other sections. These sections will be addressed in the following documentation. Celery Fides uses Celery for asynchronous task management. To simplify deployments and remove the need for two different toml configuration files, it is possible to configure Celery via the Fides configuration file. Any valid configuration key/value pair for Celery can instead be added to the Fides toml configuration file and will automatically be passed through to the Celery deployment. Note that Fides will not validate any of these key/value pairs. See the above configuration file reference for an example of using celery configuration pass-through. For a full list of possible variable overrides, see the Celery configuration documentation . Example Celery Section 1 2 3 4 [celery] event_queue_prefix = \"fides_worker\" task_default_queue = \"fides\" task_always_eager = true Credentials The credentials section uses custom keys which can be referenced in specific commands that take the --credentials-id option. For example, a command that uses a credential might look like fides scan dataset db --credentials-id app_postgres . The credential object itself will be validated at the time of use depending on what type of credential is required. For instance if fides scan system okta is used, it will expect the object to contain orgUrl and token key/value pairs. In the case of a typical database like postgres, it will only expect a connection_string. The following is an example of what a credentials section might look like in a given deployment with various applications: Example Credentials Section 1 2 [credentials] app_postgres = { connection_string = \"postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:fides@fides-db:5432/fides\" } Configuration File Reference This following file is an autogenerated configuration reference file. It shows application defaults and is a valid toml file that can be used for configuration of Fides. fides.toml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 # Fides Configuration File # Additional Documentation at : https://ethyca.github.io/fides/stable/config/ #--------------# #-- ADMIN_UI --# #--------------------------------------------------------------------# [admin_ui] # Configuration settings for the Admin UI. # Toggle whether the Admin UI is served. enabled = true # boolean #------------# #-- CELERY --# #--------------------------------------------------------------------# [celery] # Configuration settings for Celery.

This style is checked in a CI step, and merges to master are prevented if code does not conform. A number of extensions are available for popular editors that will automatically apply black to your code. Pylint Fides' code is linted using pylint . Linter checks run as part of a CI step and merges to master are prevented if code does not conform. Mypy Fides' code is statically-typed using mypy . Type checking is validated as a CI step, and merges to master are prevented if code does not pass type checks.

If you haven't already, read the Requirements Installation Guide to get up and running with the required tools and optimal configurations. Terminology For the purposes of this documentation, there is some Nox-specific terminology that is used and is helpful to understand before reading the rest of the guide. session - This is the equivalent of a single command, or a target in Make. They can be chained together arbitrarily, and the order of execution will be preserved. For example nox -s isort black posarg - This refers to a Positional Argument . These can be provided to any Nox command by putting -- at the end of a command followed by the argument that you would like to provide.

Note that due to terminal limitations, the session + param must be wrapped in quotes for proper escaping. Additionally, if a session has multiple params but none are specific, all permutations of that session will be run. Sessions to Know While there are many sessions available in our nox setup, these are the ones that you are most likely to use regularly. This is intended as a brief introduction, as many of these commands will be explained further in specific sections below. Command Description nox This is the default session that runs when no other session is provided. Automatically opens this page. nox -l Provides a list of all available nox sessions. nox -s usage -- <command> Shows the full docstring for a single session. The name of the session is provided as a positional argument. Use this whenever you want to know more about a specific session's usage. nox -s dev Spins up the Fides webserver with all required infrastructure. nox -s shell Opens an interactive shell in a running Fides webserver container. nox -s build Builds and tags docker containers. nox -s clean Completely wipes out all Docker volumes, images, and caches across the entire machine. Note: This should only be used as a last resort! If you find yourself running this command often, there is probably an issue that needs to be addressed. nox -s teardown Spins down all of the Docker containers for the Fides project. Including the -- volumes posarg will also delete the application database data. Getting Started This section will run through the basics of getting everything up and running so that you can start making changes. Docker Given that the majority of commands rely on Docker images, the first step is going to be getting some Docker images built. This is handled by the build session. As an excercise, let's check the docs for the build session via the usage session: 1 nox -s usage -- build The simplest way to build everything is to run nox -s build . This will build all available Docker images used for development and testing. Additionally, to build only a specific image(s), run nox -s usage -- build to see what params have been documented. Running the Webserver Now that all of the potential images we'll need are built, it's time to spin up the webserver: nox -s dev Depending on your computer, this will take anywhere from ~30 seconds to ~2 minutes. The webserver will log all of its activity to that window which is useful for debugging and checking potential server-side errors. Warning When running nox -s dev , if you get an importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError: fides , it means that fides was not properly installed. Run nox -s dev -- shell , and then run pip install -e . You can verify Fides is installed with pip list | grep fides Opening a Shell Now that the webserver is up and running, a convenient way to interact with it as well as the Fides CLI is to open a shell directly into the running webserver container. Open a new terminal and run the following: nox -s shell With the shell open, we'll need to authenticate before we can start using the CLI. Run the following to authenticate the shell and get ready to run the CLI: fides user login With that done, we can do things like evaluations: fides evaluate Listing all resources of a type: fides ls system and more. Run fides -h to see the full list of commands offered by the CLI. Checking Your Changes Once you've made some changes, it's time to verify that they are working as expected. If you've made changes to the CLI, you can verify them directly using the shell method described here . If you've made an API change, there are a few different ways to verify your changes. The first and most simple is to go to localhost:8080/docs and verify that the changes you made show up as expected in the documentation. This is most useful when adding a new endpoint or changing a schema. To dig in even deeper, you can use the Authorize button at the top of the API docs page to login (credentials are available in the .fides/fides.toml config file). This will allow you to send requests, view responses, etc. Running Tests For a full walkthrough on testing, head over to the Testing page. Static Checks For the sake of simplicity, all of the typical pre-commit static checks are packaged into a single session: nox -s static_checks This installs and runs the various checks in their own virtual environment for maximum consistency. For more information about code style in Fides, check Code Style . Debugging Fides in VSCode This is a quick guide to show how VSCode can be used to debug Fides running locally in Docker. The general approach is to allow the local fides Docker Compose service to allow remote debugging connections, and to start a remote debugger from a host VSCode workspace. Setup Run Fides with Remote Debugging Enabled In order to accept incoming remote debugging connections, the fides Docker Compose service must be run with slight alterations. To enable this functionality, simply add the remote_debug flag to a nox command. For example: nox -s dev -- remote_debug or nox -s dev -- remote_debug postgres timescale With those commands, the fides Docker Compose service that's running the Fides server locally is able to accept incoming remote debugging connections. Note that, at this point, the remote_debug flag is not enabled for other nox sessions, e.g. fides_env , pytest_ops , etc. Attach a Remote Debugger to the Fides Server Now that the running Fides server can accept incoming remote debugging connections, you can attach a remote debugger from a local VSCode workspace to actively debug the server application. A launch configuration is included in the fides repo to facilitate this step. Open up the fides repo in a VSCode workspace Go to the Run and Debug view From the debugger dropdown list, select the Python debugger: Remote Attach Fides configuration Click the Start Debugging play button The remote debugger should now be attached to the Fides server! To confirm the debugger is attached, at least one RUNNING line item should appear in the CALL STACK window Debug! At this point, VSCode is ready to debug the running Fides server. Try setting breakpoints and hitting them by, e.g., making certain HTTP requests against the Fides server. This guide provides more information on how to use the VSCode Python debugger. Links Some relevant VSCode documentation for reference: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_debugging-by-attaching-over-a-network-connection https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_configure-and-run-the-debugger Debugging Fides in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate This guide will show how to use the IntelliJ debugger with Fides running in Docker.

If you're looking for a general getting started guide, please see the Overview and Development Guide . API Endpoints API URLs We define API URLs for specific API versions as constants within fides.common.api.v1.urn_registry (where v1 can be substituted for that particular API version), then import those URLs into their specific API views. Since we are on the first version, there is no clear precedent set for overriding URLs between versions yet. The most likely change is that we'll override the APIRouter class instantiation with a different base path (ie. /api/v2 instead of /api/v1 ). For example: 1 2 PRIVACY_REQUEST = \"/privacy-request\" PRIVACY_REQUEST_DETAIL = \"/privacy-request/{privacy_request_id}\" would both resolve as /api/v1/privacy-request and /api/v1/privacy-request/{privacy_request_id} respectively. Database and Models The ORM -- SQLAlchemy SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper, allowing us to avoid writing direct database queries within our codebase, and access the database via Python code instead. The ORM provides an additional configuration layer allowing user-defined Python classes to be mapped to database tables and other constructs, as well as an object persistence mechanism known as the Session . Some common uses cases are listed below, for a more comprehensive guide see: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/index.html Adding models Database tables are defined with model classes. Model files should live in src/fides/api/models/ . Individual model classes must inherit from our custom base class at fides.api.db.base_class.Base to ensure uniformity within the database. Multiple models per file are encouraged so long as they fit the same logical delineation within the project. An example model declaration is added below. For a comprehensive guide see: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/mapping_styles.html#declarative-mapping You should also import your model in src/fides/api/db/base.py so it is visible for alembic. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 class Book ( Base ): __tablename__ = 'book' id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True ) name = Column ( String , index = True ) page_count = Column ( Integer , nullable = True ) author_id = Column ( Integer , ForeignKey ( \"author.id\" ), nullable = False ) When models are added to the project, we must then add them to the database in a recordable and repeatable fashion using migrations. Using the database via models Once you've added database tables via project models, you're ready to read, write, and update them via Python code. Some examples of common use cases here are listed below. Official documentation is here: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Query . Import our application's database session: from fides.api.db.session import get_db_session Instantiate the database interaction object: 1 2 SessionLocal = get_db_session ( config ) db = SessionLocal () Create a new row in a table: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 db_obj = User ( email = \"admin@fides.app\" , full_name = \"Fides Admin\" , is_superuser = True , is_active = True , ) db . add ( db_obj ) db . commit () db . refresh ( db_obj ) Fetch all objects in a table: users = db.query(User).all() Fetch all objects in a table that meet some criteria: active_users = db.query(User).filter(User.is_active == True) Get a specific row in a table: user = db.query(User).get(User.email == \"admin@fides.app\") Update a specific row in a table: 1 2 3 4 user . email = \"updated@fides.app\" db . add ( user ) db . commit () db . refresh () Connecting to the database When you run nox -s dev , the database will spin up in a Docker container with port 5432 exposed on localhost. You can connect to it using the credentials found in .fides.toml , e.g. Hostname: localhost Port: 5432 Username: see database.user in .fides.toml Password: see database.password in .fides.toml Alembic migrations Some common Alembic commands are listed below. For a comprehensive guide see: https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html . The commands will need to be run inside a shell on your Docker containers, which can be opened with nox -s dev -- shell . In the /src/fides/api/alembic directory: Migrate your database to the latest state: alembic upgrade head Merge heads (for when you have conflicting heads from a merge/rebase): alembic merge heads Get revision id of previous migration: alembic current Automatically generate a new migration: alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"<a message describing your changes>\" Create a new migration file to manually fill out: alembic revision -m \"<a message describing your changes>\" Migrate your database to a specific state alembic upgrade <revision-id> or alembic downgrade <revision-id> , (or if you want to be smart alembic upgrade <revision-id> || alembic downgrade <revision-id> is handy when you don't know whether the target revision is an upgrade or downgrade) NB. You can find the revision-id inside each migration file in alembic/versions/ on line 3 next to Revision ID: ... When working on a PR with a migration, ensure that down_revision in the generated migration file correctly references the previous migration before submitting/merging the PR. Exception Handling Our preference for exception handling is by overriding the nearest sensible error, for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 class SomeException ( ValueError ): \"a docstring\" def some_method (): raise SomeException ( \"a message\" ) General debugging -- pdb The project uses pdb for debugging as a dev-requirement . You can set breakpoints with pdb in much the same way you'd set them using debugger in JavaScript. Insert import pdb; pdb.set_trace() into the line where you want the breakpoint to set, then run your Python code. Docker As a last resort you may need to tear everything down in Docker and rebuild. The following commands will achieve that, but be warned that rebuild times can be long! 1 nox -s clean Warning If you find yourself feeling the need to run this command regularly, open an issue or slack a member of the dev team as it is not expected that this will need to be run regularly. Performance and Benchmarking The following are a few options we have for monitoring and benchmarking application performance: docker stats - Running this command will show you the CPU and Memory usage of your containers. This is very handy for quickly checking the memory footprint of an image while running. drill - This is a CLI tool used for load-testing applications. It requires Rust and OpenSSL. This is used in CI to continually benchmark performance. nox -s performance_tests - This is a convenient combination of the prior two tools that is used in CI but also possible to use locally. profile-request - When in dev_mode , Adding profile-request: true to any request header will tell the server to profile the request and send back a text response containing the profile data, instead of returning the typical JSON response. This allows arbitrary profiling of any endpoint or feature.","title":"Development Tips"},{"location":"development/development_tips/#development-tips","text":"This page is dedicated to providing further context and information around specific implementation details such as code organization, running migrations and more.

For a comprehensive guide see: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/mapping_styles.html#declarative-mapping You should also import your model in src/fides/api/db/base.py so it is visible for alembic. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 class Book ( Base ): __tablename__ = 'book' id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True ) name = Column ( String , index = True ) page_count = Column ( Integer , nullable = True ) author_id = Column ( Integer , ForeignKey ( \"author.id\" ), nullable = False ) When models are added to the project, we must then add them to the database in a recordable and repeatable fashion using migrations.","title":"Adding models"},{"location":"development/development_tips/#using-the-database-via-models","text":"Once you've added database tables via project models, you're ready to read, write, and update them via Python code.

Due to the rapid development of the project, some minor versions may also contain minor breaking changes. The best practice is to always pin versions, and carefully test before bumping to a new version. Patch versions will never cause breaking changes, and are only used to hotfix critical bugs. Release schedule Fides does not follow a set release schedule, and instead ships versions based on the addition of features and functionality. Each release, with the exception of hotfixes, contains at least one substantial new feature. Branching Fides uses continuous delivery with a single main branch. All code changes are merged into this branch. When it comes times to prepare for a new release, a release branch is created for stability and thoroughly tested. When releasing, a new tag is created on the release branch and the release process proceeds automatically. In the case of patches, a branch is created from the relevant tag. Commits are then cherry-picked into this branch, and a new patch version tag is created. Release Steps We use GitHub\u2019s release feature to tag releases that then get automatically deployed to DockerHub and PyPi via GitHub Actions. We also use a CHANGELOG.md to mitigate surprises to our users and help them plan updates accordingly. The release steps are as follows: Major and Minor Open a PR that is titled the version of the release (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Rename the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md to the new version number and put a date next to it Update the compare links for both the new version and for the new Unreleased section Once approved, merge the PR Create a new release, ensuring that the last PR to get merged is the aforementioned CHANGELOG.md update PR Add the new version as the tag (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Make the title the version with a v in front of it (i.e. v1.6.0 ) Add a link to the CHANGELOG.md Auto-populate the release notes Publish the release Patch It may be necessary for a patch release to contain only select commits to the main branch since the last major or minor release. To create a release with only the desired changes, follow the steps below: Checkout the most recent release's tag To fetch the most recent tag's name, run: 1 2 3 4 # fides on main git describe --abbrev = 0 --tags #=> 1.2.3 To checkout the most recent tag, run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 #fides on main git checkout 1 .2.3 #=> Note: switching to '1.2.3'. # # You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental # changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this # state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. # # If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may # do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example: # # git switch -c <new-branch-name> # # Or undo this operation with: # # git switch - # # Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false # # HEAD is now at 0123abcd Commit Message Tip This can be combined into a single command: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 # fides on main git checkout $( git describe --abbrev = 0 --tags ) #=> Note: switching to '1.2.3'. # # You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental # changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this # state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. # # If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may # do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example: # # git switch -c <new-branch-name> # # Or undo this operation with: # # git switch - # # Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false # # HEAD is now at 0123abcd Commit Message Create a new branch from the HEAD commit of the most recent release's tag, called release-v<tag> 1 2 3 4 # fides on tags/1.2.3 git checkout -b release-v1.2.4 #=> Switched to a new branch 'release-v1.2.4' If the changes to be included in the patch release are contained in one or more unmerged pull requests, change the base branch of the pull request(s) to the release branch created in the previous step Once approved, merge the pull request(s) into the release branch Create a new branch off of the release branch by running: 1 2 3 4 # fides on release-v1.2.4 git checkout -b prepare-release-v1.2.4 #=> Switched to a new branch 'prepare-release-v1.2.4' Optional: Incorporate any additional specific changes required for the patch release by running: 1 2 # fides on prepare-release-v1.2.4 git cherry-pick <commit>... Copy the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md and paste above the release being patched Rename Unreleased to the new version number and put a date next to it Cut and paste the documented changes that are now included in the patch release to the correct section Commit these changes Open a pull request to incorporate any cherry-picked commits and the CHANGELOG.md changes into the release branch Set the base branch of this pull request to the release branch Once approved, merge the pull request into the release branch Create a new release from the release branch Add the new version as the tag (i.e. 1.2.4 ) Title the release with the version number, prefixed with a v (i.e. v1.2.4 ) Add a link to the CHANGELOG.md Auto-populate the release notes Publish the release Merge the new release tag into main Warning Pushing commits (including merge commits) to the main branch requires admin-level repository permissions. Checkout the main branch, and update the local repository: 1 2 3 4 git checkout main #=> Switched to branch 'main'... git pull Merge the new release tag into main : 1 git merge tags/1.2.4 Handle any merge conflicts, and push to the remote main branch Release Checklist The release checklist is a manual set of checks done before each release to ensure functionality of the most critical components of the application. Some of these steps are redundant with automated tests, while others are only tested here as part of this check. This checklist should be copy/pasted into the final pre-release PR, and checked off as you complete each step. Additionally, there is a robust Release Process page available in Confluence ( internal only ). Pre-Release Steps General From the release branch, confirm the following: [ ] Quickstart works: nox -s quickstart (verify you can complete the interactive prompts from the command-line) [ ] Test environment works: nox -s \"fides_env(test)\" (verify the admin UI on localhost:8080, privacy center on localhost:3001, CLI and webserver) [ ] Have Roger run a QATouch automation run Next, run the following checks via the test environment: API [ ] Verify that the generated API docs are correct @ http://localhost:8080/docs CLI Run these from within the test environment shell: [ ] git reset --hard - Note: This is required for the pull command to work [ ] fides user login [ ] fides push src/fides/data/sample_project/sample_resources/ [ ] fides pull src/fides/data/sample_project/sample_resources/ [ ] fides evaluate src/fides/data/sample_project/sample_resources/ [ ] fides generate dataset db --credentials-id app_postgres test.yml - Note: Because the filesystem isn't mounted, the new file will only show up within the container [ ] fides scan dataset db --credentials-id app_postgres Privacy Center [ ] Every navigation button works [ ] DSR submission succeeds [ ] Consent request submission succeeds Admin UI [ ] Every navigation button works [ ] DSR approval succeeds [ ] DSR execution succeeds User Permissions [ ] Verify user creation [ ] Verify a Viewer can view all systems [ ] Verify a Data Steward can edit systems they are assigned Documentation [ ] Verify that the CHANGELOG is formatted correctly and clean up verbiage where needed [ ] Verify that the CHANGELOG is representative of the actual changes :warning: Note that any updates that need to be made to the CHANGELOG should not be commited directly to the release branch. Instead, they should be committed on a branch off of main and then PR'd and merged into main , before being cherry-picked over to the release branch. This ensures that the CHANGELOG stays consistent between the release branch and main . Publishing the release When publishing the release, be sure to include the following sections in the release description: [ ] ## Release Pull Request section that includes a link back to the release PR (i.e., this one!) for tracking purposes [ ] ## QA Touch Test Run section that includes a link to the QATouch test run (QA team should provide this) Post-Release Steps [ ] Verify the ethyca-fides release is published to PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/ethyca-fides/#history [ ] Verify the fides release is published to DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides [ ] Verify the fides-privacy-center release is published to DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides-privacy-center [ ] Verify the fides-sample-app release is published to DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides-sample-app [ ] Smoke test the PyPi & DockerHub releases: [ ] Create a fresh venv with python3 -m venv 2_12_0_venv [ ] Activate the venv source 2_12_0_venv/bin/activate [ ] pip install ethyca-fides [ ] fides deploy up [ ] Announce the release!","title":"Releases"},{"location":"development/releases/#releases","text":"","title":"Releases"},{"location":"development/releases/#versioning","text":"Fides uses semantic versioning.

There are a few important reasons to write tests: Make sure your code works Tests ensure that your code does the thing you intend it to do. If you have a function that adds two numbers, you'll want to test that it does, in fact, return their sum. If behavior depends on a configuration setting, ensure that changing that setting changes the behavior. In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected. Make sure your code doesn't not work It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken . This is especially important for a project like Fides, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code. For example, you could write tests about what you expect to happen if your function is called with incorrect (or no) arguments, or to ensure that any errors are properly trapped and handled. Tests are documentation Ultimately, your tests are the best documentation for your code. Another developer should be able to look at your tests and understand what your code does, how to invoke it, and what edge cases it contains. Therefore, try to write short, self-explanatory tests with descriptive titles. Help future developers As Fides grows, your code will be reused in more and more places, by developers who may not be familiar with the details of your implementation. Therefore, your tests are an opportunity to ensure that your code is used correctly in the future. For example, if your code needs to be used in a certain way, or expects a certain configuration, or is always expected to return a certain output, or has any other details that might impact its ability to be used in the framework, write a test for it! At minimum, you'll help a future developer understand that you consciously chose to design your code a certain way. Writing tests Fides' tests are stored in the tests directory. Tests should have descriptive names that make it clear what you're testing. If necessary, add a docstring or comment to explain why you're testing this specific thing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Good test name def test_dry_evaluate_system_fail ( server_url , resources_dict ): ... # Bad test name def test_dry_evaluate (): ... Fides has a few pytest fixtures available for testing; see conftest.py for details. Integration tests vs. mocked tests Generally, tests that include mocking are discouraged. Mocking can create a false sense of security and obfuscate possible errors in the code that only present themselves when integration tested. Running tests Given the relative complexity of the setup around Fides and reliance on Docker, test commands should usually be run in a shell or via Nox sessions. The following subsections describe how to execute both. Running Tests in a Shell As described in Developing Fides , we'll be running these tests from within a shell. As a reminder, spinning up Fides and opening a shell requires the following commands: nox -s dev Once the webserver is running from the previous command, open a new terminal and run nox -s shell You're now ready to start testing! Invoking Pytest Fides uses pytest for unit testing. Let's collect all of the available tests to verify pytest is working as expected: 1 2 # Collects all available tests without running anything pytest --collect-only Running specific tests To run a subset of tests, provide a filename or directory; to match a specific test name, use the -k flag: 1 2 # Run all tests in the tests/ctl/ directory that contain the word \"api\" in their name pytest tests/ctl/ -k api The --sw flag will exit pytest the first time it encounters an error; subsequent runs with the same flag will skip any tests that succeeded and run the failed test first. For more information on available Pytest invocation options, see the documentation here . Excluding tests Some tests also test integration with external services like Snowflake which require both internet access and authentication credentials. It is possible to skip these tests by excluding tests with the external mark. 1 2 # Run all tests except for external ones pytest -m \"not external\" This is far from the only mark used in the test suite however. To see a full list, they are all documented in the [tool.pytest] section of the pyproject.toml . Running Test Suites via Nox To run tests in a more robust and repeatable way, Nox also has extensive commands for running tests packaged with various marks and infrastructure. However, it is important to note that these commands are not designed for rapid iteration and TDD in mind, but instead for maximum reproducability. To run tests in a more TDD-style, see the section Running Tests in a Shell . Additionally, these are the exact same Nox sessions that are run in CI. Thus if you are seeing CI failures and are trying to reproduce or remediate them, it is recommended to run those failing tests locally via these Nox sessions as the results will generally always be the same. Building the Test Image The Nox test sessions assume that all of the required images have already been built. To build the Fides image used for testing, run the following command: 1 nox -s \"build(test)\" Once that is complete, you're ready to start running test sessions. Test Sessions The following table describes each pytest-related session: Session (with Param) Mark(s) Test Path Requires Credentials? Description pytest(ctl-unit) unit tests/ctl No Simplest set of ctl tests Should generally avoid the webserver but not guaranteed. pytest(ctl-integration) integration tests/ctl No Tests that are known to require the webserver. pytest(ctl-not-external) not external tests/ctl No Tests unit/integration but without touching external resources. pytest(ctl-external) external tests/ctl Yes Tests that require external resources such as Snowflake or BigQuery. pytest(ops-unit) not integration and not integration_external and not integration_saas tests/ops No As there is no \"unit\" tag within the ops tests, it is instead achieved via numerous \"not\" marks. pytest(ops-integration) N/A N/A No This is a special test case, as the handling of test running is done by run_infrastructure.py . More information and logic can be found there. pytest(ops-external-datastores) integration_external tests/ops Yes Runs tests that connect to external datastores such as Snowflake. pytest(ops-saas) integration_saas tests/ops Yes Runs tests related to the connectors code. Spins up additional local resources and connects to outside resources. pytest(lib) N/A tests/lib No Test lib module functionality. pytest(nox) N/A tests/nox No Tests functionality related to the nox session. Note For additional information, you can view the source file test_setup_nox.py that contains all of the code that runs these tests. Testing Environment Quickstart Use nox -s \"fides_env(test)\" to launch the test environment Read the terminal output for details Customize Fides ENV variables by editing .env Overview To facilitate thorough manual testing of the application, there is a comprehensive testing environment that can be set up via a single nox command: nox -s \"fides_env(test)\" . This test environment includes: Fides Server Fides Admin UI Fides Postgres Database & Redis Cache Sample \"Cookie House\" Application Test Postgres Database Test Redis Database Sample Resources Sample Connectors etc. This test environment is exactly the same environment that users can launch themselves using fides deploy up , and you can find all the configuration and settings in src/fides/data/sample_project . Configuration There are two ways to configure the fides server and CLI: Editing the ENV file in the project root: .env Editing the TOML file in the sample project files: src/fides/data/sample_project/fides.toml The .env file is safest to add secrets and local customizations, since it is .gitignore 'd and will not be accidentally committed to version control. The fides.toml file should be used for configurations that should be present for all users testing out the application. Advanced Usage The environment will work \"out of the box\", but can also be configured to enable other features like S3 storage, email notifications, etc. To configure these, you'll need to edit the .env file and provide some secrets - see example.env for what is supported. Automated Cypress E2E Tests The test environment is also used to run automated end-to-end (E2E) tests via Cypress. Use nox -s e2e_test to run this locally.","title":"Testing"},{"location":"development/testing/#testing","text":"Fides loves tests!

Prerequisites To run and develop the Fides UI components locally, you'll need to do the following: Clone the Fides repository Install Node.js Globally install Turbo In the clients folder, run npm install . This will install the dev dependency turbo . This will also install the appropriate dependencies in clients and in each client within clients folder. You may need to first remove all node_modules in each of the clients (admin-ui, privacy-center, etc) Dependencies within this directory are managed by Turborepo. Our root package.json file defines 3 workspaces (or packages) that are part of the Turbo ecosystem: admin-ui privacy-center fides-js Running Locally 1 turbo run dev Running this in the root clients folder will result in every workspace being run. Running this command within admin-ui will result in only admin-ui being run. Available commands that exist for every workspace are defined in the root turbo.json file, while commands unique to a specific workspace are defined in the turbo.json file within the workspace. It's important to use the turbo command because, as you see in the turbo.json files, we've defined some dependencies and caching details on some turbo commands. Adding packages To install packages in any package in clients , run the following from clients : 1 npm install <package> --workspace = <workspace> Example: 1 npm install react --workspace = admin-ui See https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/package-installation#addingremovingupgrading-packages for more details","title":"Overview"},{"location":"development/ui/overview/#ui-development-overview","text":"The /clients directory houses all front-end packages and shared code amongst clients, and also includes e2e tests.","title":"UI Development Overview"},{"location":"development/ui/overview/#prerequisites","text":"To run and develop the Fides UI components locally, you'll need to do the following: Clone the Fides repository Install Node.js Globally install Turbo In the clients folder, run npm install .

Development To serve this application locally, first install your local dependencies at the root client directory level: In /clients : 1 npm install Then, run: 1 2 cd privacy-center turbo run dev This will automatically build and run the project. Building To build this application directly, run: 1 turbo run build As a Next application, it will output build artifacts to the .next directory. API The Privacy Center is a full-stack webserver but generally makes all it's API calls to the connected Fides server. However, it does host a small API of it's own that enables some basic \"edge\" functions like hosting a customized bundle of the fides.js script. To view the OpenAPI documentation, run the application locally and visit the /docs page for details: http://localhost:3000/docs Testing To run the interactive test interface, run: 1 turbo run test For a fully-loaded development & test setup of both the Privacy Center, run the following commands in two separate terminals: 1 2 cd privacy-center && turbo run dev cd privacy-center && turbo run cy:open There are two ways to test Fides consent components: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/fides-js-components-demo.html . This page comes pre-packaged with some default configurations to get up and running quickly with the consent components, and is also the page used by cypress e2e tests. To test other configurations, edit the fidesConfig object passed into Fides.init() in privacy-center/public/fides-js-components-demo.html . Navigate to http://localhost:3000/fides-js-demo.html . This page, unlike the above, calls the /api/fides-js Privacy Center endpoint. This endpoint loads config from the privacy center's legacy config.json , so it's closer to how a customer would actually use the fides-js package. In addition, we inject only the minimal config into fides-js . The overlay is not enabled by default on this page. Deployment To deploy this site, typically you should use the published ethyca/fides-privacy-center Docker image which is production-built Next.js image. See https://docs.ethyca.com for more! Configuration You may configure the appearance of this web application at build time by modifying the config.json file inside the config directory. You're able to control: The header of the document The descriptive text of the document Which actions are present, and each action's: Personally Identifying Information a user must submit Title Description Icon Policy key Whether consent management is enabled Consent options: Personally Identifying Information a user must submit Title Description Icon Which consent management options are present, and each option's: The Fides Data Use that the user may consent to Descriptive information for the type of consent The default consent state (opt in/out): This can be a single boolean which will apply when the user has not modified their consent. Or this can be an object with consent values that depend on the user's consent context, such as whether they are using Global Privacy Control. See fides-js for details. The cookie keys that will be available to fides.js , which can be used to access a user's consent choices outside of the Privacy Center. Whether the user's consent choice should be propagated to any configured third party services (executable). Note that currently, only one option may be marked executable at a time. You can also add any CSS you'd like to the page by adding it to the config.css file inside the config directory. Additionally, if you're handy with React and are feeling a little brave you can customize the entire application by modifying the TypeScript source code in pages/index.tsx and components/RequestModal.tsx . Configuring CSS In order to modify the way your application appears visually, you can add custom css to the config/config.css file. For example, to change the application's font to Courier: 1 2 3 * { font-family : Courier !important ; } Additionally, because this application uses CSS variables, you can modify those CSS variables directly, rather than adding custom CSS. The only caveat to this is that we need to do so in a way that overrides the CSS variables' original values so that we can avoid the complexity of modifying the JavaScript file that holds the base values. Our recommendation is that you do so by using selector specificity, as in the following example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 : root : root { /* Changes the text color to red */ --chakra-colors-gray-600 : #f00 ; /* Changes the background color to blue */ --chakra-colors-gray-50 : #00f ; } Not exactly the most appealing color scheme \u2013 but note that wherever those variables are used, they have been replaced. This allows you to modify the theme of the application consistently and with a single source of truth, adhering to modern CSS best practices.","title":"Privacy Center"},{"location":"development/ui/privacy_center/#privacy-center","text":"A web application built in Next.js to collect privacy requests from users: access, erasure, consent, and more!","title":"Privacy Center"},{"location":"development/ui/privacy_center/#development","text":"To serve this application locally, first install your local dependencies at the root client directory level: In /clients : 1 npm install Then, run: 1 2 cd privacy-center turbo run dev This will automatically build and run the project.","title":"Development"},{"location":"development/ui/privacy_center/#building","text":"To build this application directly, run: 1 turbo run build As a Next application, it will output build artifacts to the .next directory.","title":"Building"},{"location":"development/ui/privacy_center/#api","text":"The Privacy Center is a full-stack webserver but generally makes all it's API calls to the connected Fides server.
