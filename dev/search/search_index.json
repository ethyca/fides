This includes support for major privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR , CCPA and LGPD ) and standards like ISO 19944 by default. Fides can manage both enforcement of privacy in your CI pipeline and orchestration of data privacy requests in your runtime environment. Why is it called Fides? Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for \"honor and credibility\" in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means \"reliability\": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal . As we considered naming conventions, Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software. If you'd like a brief Roman mythology lesson, check out Fides on Wikipedia . Key Features Privacy as Code You describe your datasets and code using Fides' high-level description language in human-readable, declarative manifest files. This allows you to create a consistent, versioned definition of privacy characteristics in your code to automate reporting, evaluate risk and execute policies against. Automated Privacy Checks Fides integrates with git using the fidesctl tool to allow you to automate privacy checks in your CI pipeline and evalute changes against your privacy policies on each commit. This allows you to review changes and assure they meet your privacy policies before deployment. Support all Privacy Standards Fides ships with a comprehensive taxonomy that allows you to efficiently describe the privacy behaviors of your system for major regulations, including GDPR , CCPA and LGPD as well as major standards like ISO 19944 . Extensible Taxonomy Fides' taxonomy can be easily extended, allowing teams to add support for system specific concepts or data types while inheriting concepts to ensure compliance with global privacy regulations. Automate Privacy Reporting Fides' declarations can be configurd to automatically generate privacy review reports suitable for privacy and legal team review. This allows developers to focus on implementation while providing privacy teams with greater insight into the software's behavior. Data Privacy Rights Automation Fides' data orchestration capabilities mean you can use declarations to generate complex data rights automated processes that execute automatically against user's privacy rights requests. This allows you to easily configure automated, API driven privacy requests for access, erasure and de-identification of data. Next Steps To start learning how Fides works, visit the Tutorial page to walkthrough using the taxonomy, annotating datasets and systems, writing and evaluating policies, and more.

We're a venture-backed privacy technology team headquartered in New York, but working as a distributed team across the US to solve what we believe is the most important problem in technology today: the human right to privacy in vastly complex data-driven systems. What is Fides? Fides is a universally understandable, open-source language that can be used to describe privacy within tech infrastructure. Our existing tools ( Fidesctl and Fidesops ) use this language to power a low friction set of developer tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines, making privacy a feature of your tech stack. With Fides, we hope everyone can build better tools for privacy in the next decade and beyond. What we Believe Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction-filled and complicated. We're building open-source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack. The Future We've been working on this problem since 2018 and have a clear view of our next five years. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it the comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments. This means building solutions for automated privacy analysis, context rich data classification, automated data orchestration for privacy rights, semantic access control models, and more. We'd love you to contribute to Fides and you can do this directly as part of the open-source community. If you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software, join us now and get paid to work on this problem too! Your Participation Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement and an interopable standard for wide adoption. Your feedback, contributions and improvements are encouraged as we work towards building a community with the sole objective of building more repsectful software for everyone on the internet.","title":"About Ethyca"},{"location":"ethyca/#about-ethyca","text":"The mission of Ethyca is to make Internet-scale technology respectful and ethical.

In order to create a positive and welcoming environment, all interactions are governed by the Fides Code of Conduct . Guidelines Whether it's giving us feedback, raising a question, or showing your Fides-related work, we are looking forward to hearing from you. The Fides community is vibrant because of the quality of its members and the discussions they bring. To keep the workspace inviting and helpful for everyone, there are a few guidelines that we ask all members to follow. Rule 1: Assume Positive Intent Being nice is the most important pillar of the Fides community. We are considerate to each other's effort and time. It's also easy to misinterpret people through Slack, so we make an extra effort to chat in a positive tone. We assume that you are here to learn and exchange ideas, and we ask that you contribute to making a welcoming community. If someone is helping you, be mindful of the effort they are putting in. While we are always happy to help users, we can not help users with step-by-step debugging. Use your professional judgment in discerning whether requests are unreasonable. The Fides team always tries to listen to the community. Please be understanding if your issue or feature request is not deemed an immediate priority. Rule 2: Use threads for larger messages Because of the size of our community and frequency of posts, it's easy for large messages to drown out smaller messages. Using threads helps people see more messages on their screen. Larger code blocks should be posted in threads. Rule 3: Avoid posting sensitive information Community members sometimes need to post code snippets as they ask for help. Be sure to remove sensitive information from posts to the public channels. If your Fides account information is needed to help you, we will ask you to direct message such information. Be cautious of anyone asking for information through direct messages. Rule 4: Write high quality questions The Fides community is here to support you. That said, it is significantly easier to answer well-researched and clearly-written questions. Even adding potentially relevant links to a post helps tremendously. Informative Slack threads are archived by our resident bot Marvin. Having well-written threads helps future users encountering the same problem. Oftentimes your question may have been answered somewhere else; some good resources to start looking before asking a question: Fides Documentation GitHub Issues StackOverflow Rule 5: Don't abuse tagging users Requests for help will be seen by the Fides team, and will be directed to the appropriate person. Tagging individual users is highly discouraged unless it is in the context of a conversation thread. Rule 6: Avoid using DMs to ask for help Fides employees should not be sent questions in DMs unless we specifically ask you to send us private information. There are times when it makes sense to directly message another community member experiencing a similar issue, or working with similar technologies. Just be aware that some people may not want to be messaged. It also helps other people if you post your question publicly. Similar to above, informative Slack threads are archived. Having conversations in public channels drives better quality discussions that can be referenced in the future. Rule 7: Don't advertise material unrelated to Fides Our community is in the channel to learn more about Fides. Showing us Fides-related stuff that you're working on is highly encouraged. Advertising products and events unrelated to Fides will be removed.","title":"Community Hints & Tips"},{"location":"community/hints_tips/#community","text":"The Fides project welcomes issues, contributions and discussion from all users, regardless of background or experience level.

The pre-commit package is included in the dev-requirements.txt . Once that is installed, follow these steps to get up and running: pre-commit install - This is a one-time setup step to create the git pre-commit hooks. These pre-commit hooks will now run automatically. However you can also use pre-commit run to run them manually once all of your changes have been staged. NOTE : A Python interpreter must be available from wherever the git commands are being run, as this is required to run the pre-commit package. CI Checks CI checks are stored as targets within the Noxfile, and can be run from the top-level fides directory with the following pattern: Pattern 1 nox -s <lowercased_name> Examples 1 2 3 nox -s black nox -s mypy nox -s xenon Black formatting Fidesctl's code is formatted using the black style. This style is checked in a CI step, and merges to master are prevented if code does not conform. A number of extensions are available for popular editors that will automatically apply black to your code. Pylint Fidesctl's code is linted using pylint . Linter checks run as part of a CI step and merges to master are prevented if code does not conform. Mypy Fidesctl's code is statically-typed using mypy . Type checking is validated as a CI step, and merges to master are prevented if code does not pass type checks. As a general rule, mypy typing requires all function arguments and return values to be annotated. Xenon Fidesctl's code is checked for its cyclomatic-complexity by Xenon. If a single logical piece of code is deemed too complex, then a CI step will fail, at which point the focus should be on breaking up said complex function/method/class.","title":"Code Style"},{"location":"development/code_style/#code-style","text":"","title":"Code Style"},{"location":"development/code_style/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"development/code_style/#docstrings","text":"Docstrings are required for every function, class and method.

This section of the docs is designed to help you become familiar with how we work, the standards we apply, and how to ensure your contribution is successful. If you're stuck, don't be shy about asking for help on GitHub . Getting Started The first step is to clone the Fidesctl repo for development: 1 git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides Once that's complete, there are a few different ways to spin up the project and get coding! Developer Workflows There are a few different ways to develop Fidesctl, they are listed below in order of how strongly they are recommended! If you're using VS Code, the recommended way to work on Fidesctl is by leveraging the Dev Containers feature. The repo has a .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file already included that will set up a complete environment in VS Code, including the suggested VS Code extensions and settings. Follow these steps to get started: Install the Remote-Containers extension for VS Code. Open the command window (the F1 key will open it, by default) and select the Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container... command. Click \"Open\", without having selected any specific folder. The containers will now spin up and VS Code will be running inside of the containers. The bottom left of the IDE will now say Dev Container: Fidesctl . When you open a new VS Code shell, it will be inside of the fidesctl container, and you'll have access to all of the fidesctl commands as well as any Python commands like pytest , black , mypy , etc. If you're using an editor besides VS Code, then the next best way to work on Fidesctl is by utilizing the Noxfile commands: Make sure that you have docker , docker-compose and nox ( pip install nox ) installed. Once you have everything set up, run nox -s cli to spin up a shell within the fidesctl container. You can and should run all of your various development commands from within this shell, such as pytest , black , etc. Finally, the least-recommended method would be to install the project in your local environment and develop directly. Write your code We have no doubt you can write amazing code! However, we want to help you ensure your code plays nicely with the rest of the Fidesctl ecosystem. Many projects describe code style and documentation as a suggestion; in Fidesctl it's a CI-checked requirement. To learn how to style your code, see the style guide . To learn how to migrate the database schema, see the database migration guide . To learn how to document your code, see the docs guide . To learn how to test your code, see the tests guide . To learn what format your PR should follow, make sure to follow the pull request guidelines . Submit your code In order to submit code to Fidesctl, please: Fork the Fidesctl repository Create a new branch on your fork Open a Pull Request once your work is ready for review Once automated tests have passed, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved.

Due to the rapid development of the project, some minor versions may also contain minor breaking changes. Best practice is always pinning versions and carefully testing before bumping to a new version. Patch versions will never cause breaking changes, and are only used to hotfix critical bugs. Release Schedule Fidesctl does not follow a set release schedule, but instead ships versions based on the addition of features/functionality. Each release, with the exception of hotfixes, will contain at least one substantial new feature. Planning For each release a corresponding GitHub Project is created. These projects can be found here . Issues are then added to release projects as a way to organize what will be included in each release. Once a release project is complete and the core team signs off on the readiness of the release, a new version is cut using GitHub releases. You can see all fidesctl releases here . Each new release triggers a GitHub Action that pushes the new version to PyPI as well as pushes a clean version to DockerHub. The release project is then marked as closed . Hotfixes are an exception to this and can be added and pushed as patch versions when needed. Branching Fidesctl uses continuous delivery with a single main branch. All code changes get merged into this branch. For releases, a new tag is created and the release process kicks off automatically. In the case of patches, a branch is created from the relevant tag and commits are then cherry-picked into it and a new patch version tag is created. Release Steps We use GitHub\u2019s release feature to tag releases that then get automatically deployed to DockerHub & PyPi via GitHub Actions pipelines. We also use a CHANGELOG.md to make sure that our users are never surprised about an upcoming change and can plan upgrades accordingly. The release steps are as follows: Major Open a PR that is titled the version of the release (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Rename the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md to the new version number and put a date next to it Update the compare links for both the new version and for the new Unreleased section Once approved, merge the PR Create a new release, ensuring that the last PR to get merged is the aforementioned CHANGELOG.md update PR Add the new version as the tag (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Make the title the version with a v in front of it (i.e. v1.6.0 ) Add a link to the CHANGELOG.md Auto-populate the release notes Publish the release Minor Create a new branch from the latest tagged release being patched (i.e. 1.6.0 ) Use git cherry-pick <commit> to incorporate specific changes required for the minor release Copy the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md and paste above the release being patched Rename Unreleased to the new version number and put a date next to it Cut and paste the changes documented that are now included in the minor release in the correct section Open a PR that is titled the version of the release (i.e. 1.6.1 ), add the do not merge label Due to potential merge conflicts when opening against main, checks may need to be run manually Create a new release, using the branch created in step 1 Add the new version as the tag (i.e. 1.6.1 ) Make the title the version with a v in front of it (i.e. v1.6.1 ) Add a link to the CHANGELOG.md (the changes are not merged yet but can be planned for) Auto-populate the release notes Publish the release Create a new branch from main Copy the changes from CHANGELOG.md for the minor release into the new branch Open a separate PR for the CHANGELOG.md updates for the minor release, once approved merge the PR Close the original PR made for the release (labeled do not merge ) without merging","title":"Releases"},{"location":"development/releases/#releases","text":"","title":"Releases"},{"location":"development/releases/#versioning","text":"Fidesctl uses semantic versioning.

There are a few important reasons to write tests: Make sure your code works Tests ensure that your code does the thing you intend it to do. If you have a function that adds two numbers, you'll want to test that it does, in fact, return their sum. If behavior depends on a configuration setting, ensure that changing that setting changes the behavior. In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected. Make sure your code doesn't not work It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken . This is especially important for a project like Fidesctl, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code. For example, you could write tests about what you expect to happen if your function is called with incorrect (or no) arguments, or to ensure that any errors are properly trapped and handled. Tests are documentation Ultimately, your tests are the best documentation for your code. Another developer should be able to look at your tests and understand what your code does, how to invoke it, and what edge cases it contains. Therefore, try to write short, self-explanatory tests with descriptive titles.

The CLI will connect to a given resource and automatically generate a non-annotated resource YAML file in the specified location. Once you have created your resources you will need to keep them up to date. The scan command is available to compare your resources and what is defined in your fidesctl server or resource files. The command will exit in error if a coverage threshold is not met. The scan and generate commands work best when used in tandem as they follow an expected resource format. The fidesctl format must be followed in order to be able to track coverage. Working With a Database The generate command can connect to a database and automatically generate resource YAML file based on the database schema. Providing Credentials Database credentials are provided as part of the connection string supplied. The connection string can be supplied as a command option or the fides config. Command Options A connection string can be supplied using the connection-string option: 1 2 3 ... --connection-string <my_connection_string> ... Fides Config A connection string can also be defined within your fides config under the credentials section. 1 2 [ credentials ] my_database_credentials = { connection_string = \"<my_connection_string>\" } Your command can then reference the key defined in your config. 1 2 3 ... --credentials-id \"my_database_credentials\" ... It is possible to use an environment variable to set credentials config values if persisting your connection string to a file is problematic. To set a connection string you can set the environment variable with a prefix of FIDESCTL__CREDENTIALS__ and __ as the nested key delimiter: 1 export FIDESCTL__CREDENTIALS__MY_DATABASE_CREDENTIALS__CONNECTION_STRING = \"<my_database_credentials>\" Generating a Dataset Given a database schema with a single users table as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 flaskr = # SELECT * FROM users; id | created_at | email | password | first_name | last_name ----+---------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------+------------+----------- 1 | 2020 -01-01 00 :00:00 | admin@example.com | pbkdf2:sha256:260000 $O87nanbSkl ... | Admin | User 2 | 2020 -01-03 00 :00:00 | user@example.com | pbkdf2:sha256:260000 $PGcBy5NzZe ... | Example | User ( 2 rows ) We can invoke the generate command by providing a connection url for this database: 1 2 3 ./venv/bin/fidesctl generate dataset db \\ fides_resources/flaskr_postgres_dataset.yml \\ --connection-string postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/flaskr The result is a resource file with a dataset with collections and fields to represent our schema: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 dataset : - fides_key : public organization_fides_key : default_organization name : public description : 'Fides Generated Description for Schema: public' meta : null data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified collections : - name : public.users description : 'Fides Generated Description for Table: public.users' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified fields : - name : created_at description : 'Fides Generated Description for Column: created_at' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified - name : email description : 'Fides Generated Description for Column: email' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified - name : first_name description : 'Fides Generated Description for Column: first_name' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified - name : id description : 'Fides Generated Description for Column: id' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified - name : last_name description : 'Fides Generated Description for Column: last_name' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified - name : password description : 'Fides Generated Description for Column: password' data_categories : [] data_qualifier : aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified The resulting file still requires annotating the dataset with data categories to represent what is stored.

Successfully scanned the following datasets: public Annotation coverage: 100 % Working With an AWS Account The generate command can connect to an AWS account and automatically generate resource YAML file based on tracked resources. Providing Credentials AWS credentials can be provided through command options, environment variables or the fides config. Command Options Credentials can be directly supplied in your command using the access_key_id , secret_access_key , and region options. 1 2 3 4 5 ... --access_key_id \"<my_access_key_id>\" --secret_access_key \"<my_secret_access_key>\" --region \"us-east-1\" ... Environment Variables The simplest way to authenticate through environment variables is to set an SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and ACCESS_KEY_ID , as defined by boto3 : 1 2 3 export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = \"<my_access_key_id>\" export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = \"<my_access_key>\" export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = \"us-east-1\" It is also possible to reference a profile: 1 2 export AWS_PROFILE = \"my_profile_1\" export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = \"us-east-1\" Fides Config Credentials can be defined within your fides config under the credentials section. 1 2 [ credentials ] my_aws_credentials = { aws_access_key_id = \"<my_aws_access_key_id>\" , aws_secret_access_key = \"<my_aws_secret_access_key>\" , region_name = \"us-east-1\" } Your command can then reference the key defined in your config. 1 2 3 ... --credentials-id \"my_aws_credentials\" ...

The ignore_resource_arn filter can exclude any resources with an exact matching Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and also supports wildcards in individual ARN fields. An empty ARN field in the filter pattern works as a wildcard. The filter can be added to the organization model within your manifest file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 organization : - fides_key : default_organization name : default_organization fidesctl_meta : resource_filters : - type : ignore_resource_arn value : 'arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:910934740016:db:database-2' In the above example we explicitly ignore a single rds database but if we wanted to ignore all rds databases we could remove the partition, account id, region and database name ARN fields: 1 2 3 resource_filters : - type : ignore_resource_arn value : 'arn::rds:::db:' Any ARN field can be wildcarded by leaving it empty.

Categories of Individuals The name of your newly extended data_subject set in a Privacy Declaration. Categories of Recipients The recipients defined in your extended Data Use. Article 6 Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Data The legal_basis defined in your extended Data Use. Article 9 Condition for Processing Special Category Data The special_category defined in your extended Data Use. Legitimate Interests for the Processing If the legal_basis is \"Legitimate Interests\" , the Data Use name is used to identify what the legitimate interest data use is. Link to Record of Legitimate Interests Assessment If the legal_basis is \"Legitimate Interests\" , a legitimate interests impact assessment is required and should be set using the legitimate_interest_impact_assessment property. Rights Available to Individuals The rights defined in your extended Data Subject based on the strategy used. Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling The boolean value for automated_decisions_or_profiling , defined in your extended Data Subject. Additional Learning The provided demo_system.yml includes a second System, Demo Analytics , which can be enhanced in the same way as the Demo Marketing System. Follow the guide to extend the taxonomy again, this time for the Demo Analytics System, to have both systems fully compliant! Next Steps We hope this was helpful in understanding the additional properties required for generating an Article 30 compliant RoPA!

Fidesctl consists of multiple components, possibly distributed among various physical or virtual machines. Fidesctl can be deployed flexibly, meeting the needs of various environments with different levels of complexity. You should also check-out the prerequisites that must be fulfilled when installing fidesctl. Fidesctl requires additional dependencies to be installed - which can be done via extras . When you install fidesctl, you need to setup the database which must also be kept updated when fidesctl is upgraded. Installation Tools Only pip installations are currently officially supported. For more details see Installation from PyPI In some cases a lightweight installation might be desired, for instance, if the webserver is not needed. If this is the case, our pip installation supports optional dependencies. While there are some successes with using other tools like poetry or pip-tools, they do not share the same workflow as the supported tools - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management. Installing via Poetry or pip-tools is not currently supported. If you wish to install fidesctl using those tools you do so at your own discretion. When this option works best This installation method is useful when you are not familiar with containers and Docker and want to install fidesctl on physical or virtual machines and you are used to installing and running software using custom deployment mechanism. The only officially supported mechanisms of installation is pip. Intended users Users who are familiar with installing and configuring Python applications, managing Python environments, dependencies and running software with their custom deployment mechanisms. What are you expected to handle You are expected to install fidesctl - all components of it - on your own. You should develop and handle the deployment for all components of fidesctl. You are responsible for setting up the database, automated startup and recovery, maintenance, cleanup and upgrades of fidesctl. What the Fidesctl community provides for this method You have Installation from PyPI on how to install the software but due to various environments and tools you might want to use, you might expect that there will be problems which are specific to your deployment and environment that you will have to diagnose and solve. You have the Running fidesctl Locally guide where you can see an example of running fidesctl with minimal dependencies and setup. You can use this guide to start fidesctl quickly for local testing and development, however this is only intended to provide inspiration, not to represent a production-grade installation. Where to ask for help For quick and general troubleshooting questions, visit the #troubleshooting channel on the fidesctl Slack. For longer discussions or to share information, visit the GitHub discussions page. If you can provide description of a reproducible problem with the fidesctl software, you can open issue in GitHub issues . Using Production Docker Images More details: Installation from Docker When this option works best This installation method is useful if you are familiar with the container/Docker stack. It provides a capability of running fidesctl components in isolation from other software running on the same physical or virtual machines with easy maintenance of dependencies. The images are built by fidesctl CI/CD pipelines and offer versions for official releases as well as for every commit made to the main branch. For this reason, it is highly discouraged to use the latest tag, as any non-official release versions may contain some instability. Intended users Users who are familiar with containers and Docker stack and understand how to build and extend their own container images. Users who know how to create deployments using Docker by linking together multiple Docker containers and maintaining such deployments. What are you expected to handle You are expected to be able to customize or extend container/Docker images if you want to add extra dependencies. You are expected to put together a deployment built of several containers (for example using docker-compose) and to make sure that they are linked together. You are responsible for setting up the database, automated startup and recovery, maintenance, cleanup and upgrades of fidesctl. You should choose the right deployment mechanism. There a number of available options of deployments of containers. You can use your own custom mechanism, custom Kubernetes deployments, custom Docker Compose, custom Helm charts etc., and you should choose it based on your experience and expectations.

For more details see Installation from PyPI In some cases a lightweight installation might be desired, for instance, if the webserver is not needed. If this is the case, our pip installation supports optional dependencies. While there are some successes with using other tools like poetry or pip-tools, they do not share the same workflow as the supported tools - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management. Installing via Poetry or pip-tools is not currently supported. If you wish to install fidesctl using those tools you do so at your own discretion. When this option works best This installation method is useful when you are not familiar with containers and Docker and want to install fidesctl on physical or virtual machines and you are used to installing and running software using custom deployment mechanism. The only officially supported mechanisms of installation is pip. Intended users Users who are familiar with installing and configuring Python applications, managing Python environments, dependencies and running software with their custom deployment mechanisms. What are you expected to handle You are expected to install fidesctl - all components of it - on your own. You should develop and handle the deployment for all components of fidesctl. You are responsible for setting up the database, automated startup and recovery, maintenance, cleanup and upgrades of fidesctl. What the Fidesctl community provides for this method You have Installation from PyPI on how to install the software but due to various environments and tools you might want to use, you might expect that there will be problems which are specific to your deployment and environment that you will have to diagnose and solve.

About the Fides Language The Fides language is based on YAML configuration files. YAML provides a well-understood structure, upon which the Fides language adds helpful primitives which represent types of data, processes or policies. By declaring these primitives with Fides you can describe: what types of data your application process (using Fides data_category annotations) how your system uses that data (using Fides data_use annotations) what policies you want your system to adhere to (using Fides Policy resources) etc. All other language features exist only to make the definition of privacy primitives more flexible and convenient.

This page describes the syntax of the language in more detail to help better interpret Fides whether you're authoring or reading. The Fides language is an intentionally simple language designed to be relatively easy for anyone to read and write. The primary objective is to translate complex privacy compliance concepts into a simple syntax, it's for this reason Fides is entirely written as YAML configurations. YAML - Building Block of Fides Fides Taxonomy The Fides language is intentionally simple. To assure this, Fides declarations use predefined primitives (e.g. data categories) that are used when describing your datasets, systems, policies, etc. These predefined primitives exist as part of the Fides taxonomy which is maintained in your fidesctl server so they can be consistently used across your organization's development team. You can learn more about the taxonomy structure and how to extend it in the taxonomy guide . Dot Notation and Snake_Case To make writing and reading Fides language as easy for humans as possible, declarations from the privacy taxonomy use dot notation for the keys and use snake_case compound labels. For example, to describe a field in a database as information provided by a user that is personally identifiable, you can write it's data category as: 1 2 # This declares that the data is provided by the user and identifies them directly user.provided.identifiable If we require greater specificity that just \"identifiable\", we could declare the contact type as a phone number by using a more specific sub-category: 1 2 3 # This declares that the is data provided by the user, # identifies them directly and is from the contact category and of type phone number. user.provided.identifiable.contact.phone_number The diagram below shows you the structure of that statement: notation-conventions Key-Value The key-value is YAML, and Fides', basic building block. Every item in a Fides YAML document is a member of at least one dictionary. The key is always a string . The value is a scalar so that it can be any datatype. So the value can be a string , a number , or another dictionary - most commonly in Fides, this will be a string that may provide a description or a pointer to a reference object in the taxonomy. If we use the example of a user's contact email, to correctly declare this in valid Fides YAML as part of a Dataset, it would be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 fields : # Group of fields in the dataset. - name : email description : User's Email data_categories : # Data category label(s) to assign field. - user.provided.identifiable.contact.email - account.contact.email The key for each key-value pair determines what value types are valid (for example, a resource type such as data_categories must use values from the Data Categories taxonomy), but many keys accept arbitrary strings as descriptive labels. Finally, as you see in the example above, keys such as data_categories accept a list of values for multi-labeling. In this case, the field email has been assigned the value user provided identifiable contact email as well as account related contact email , indicating that it may be either of those categories when used. Character Encoding Fides configuration files must always be UTF-8 encoded. While the delimiters of the language are all ASCII characters, Fides accepts non-ASCII characters in key-values, comments, and string values.","title":"Syntax"},{"location":"language/syntax/#fides-configuration-syntax","text":"Other pages in this language section describe various concepts and resources that appear in the Fides language.

Summary of Taxonomy Classification Groups 1. Data Categories Data Categories are labels to describe the type of data processed by your software. These are most heavily used by the System and Dataset resources, where you can assign one or more data categories to each field. Data Categories are hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can classify data coarsely with a high-level category (e.g. user.provided data), or you can classify it with greater precision using subcategories (e.g. user.provided.identifiable.contact.email data). Learn more about Data Categories in the taxonomy reference now . 2. Data Uses Data Uses are labels that describe how, or for what purpose(s) a component of your system is using data. Data Uses are also hierarchical with natural inheritance, meaning you can easily describe what you're using data for either coarsely (e.g. provide.system.operations ) or with more precision using subcategories (e.g. provide.system.operations.support.optimization ). Learn more about Data Uses in the taxonomy reference now . 3. Data Subjects Data Subject is a label commonly used in the regulatory world to describe the users of a system who's data is being processed. In many systems a generic user label may be sufficient, however Fides language is intended to provide greater control through specificity where needed. Examples of this are: anonymous_user employee customer patient next_of_kin Learn more about Data Subjects in the taxonomy reference now . 4. Data Qualifiers Data Qualifiers describe the degree of identification of the given data. Think of this as a spectrum: on one end is completely anonymous data, i.e. it is impossible to identify an individual from it, and on the other end is data that specifically identifies an individual. Along this spectrum are labels that describe the degree of identification that a given data might provide, such as: identified anonymized aggregated Learn more about Data Qualifiers in the taxonomy reference now . Extensibility & Interopability The Fides language is designed to support common privacy compliance regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944.

These steps closely follow the example found in the ethyca/fidesdemo repository here . You will run a local instance of a basic web app to demonstrate the use of Fidesctl as part of a \"real\" project that uses: Flask to run a web server simulating a basic e-commerce application PostgreSQL as the application's database SQLAlchemy to connect to the database fidesctl to declare privacy manifests and evaluate policies The app itself is the Flask tutorial app , but modified to simulate an e-commerce marketplace. This helps to highlight some basic examples of data categories that might be stored in a \"real\" user-facing application. Setup Instructions System Requirements Before beginning, ensure you have the following software installed and configured to your liking: Docker (v12+) Python (v3.8+) pg_config (required for the Python project. Installed via Homebrew with brew install libpq or brew install postgres .) Installation Clone the ethyca/fidesdemo repository to your machine. Checkout the repository's tutorial-start tag : 1 git checkout tutorial-start Each step in this tutorial will explain the changes made in each commit of the fidesdemo repository. You can follow along by checking out each one, or by building everything yourself and comparing your work to each commit's changeset. Navigate to the repository directory in your command line, and run: 1 make install This will create the project's virtual environment, and set up all required containers, databases, and dependencies.

Note: In a production app this directory can have any name, but it's a best practice to create a specific directory to house the fidesctl manifest files. Fundamentally, the data ecosystem is built on data that is stored somewhere . In fidesctl, Datasets are used for granular, field-level annotations of exactly what data your systems are storing and where that data is stored. For example, an app might declare one dataset for a Postgres application database, a second dataset for a Mongo orders collection, and a third dataset for some CSV files in cloud storage. The Dataset resource provides a database-agnostic way to annotate the fields stored in these systems with Data Categories, providing a metadata layer consumable by other tooling. This app contains a single PostgreSQL dataset. Create a dataset resource to annotate it by adding a flaskr_postgres_dataset.yml file to the fides_resources directory.

The language is built on declaring the types of data found in storage for your organization. In traditional SQL, fidesctl defines the following: \"datasets\" as database schemas \"collections\" as database tables \"fields\" as database columns For NoSQL datasets, fidesctl defines the following: \"dataset\" \"collection\" as a logical grouping of data fields (ie: in MongoDB, this is called a \"Collection\") \"fields\" as a reference to an individual data element (ie: in MongoDB, this is called a \"field\") Additionally, fideslang has attributes that describe what kind of data is contained in this dataset. We use the following attributes to describe the data: Name Type Description name String The name of this field description String A description of what this field contains data_categories List[FidesKey] The types of sensitive data, as defined by the taxonomy, that can be found in this field data_qualifier FidesKey The level of deidentification for the dataset For more detail on Dataset resources, see the full Dataset resource documentation .

Later, you can make exceptions (if you are working on a project that requires these categories). Understanding the Policy The purpose of a privacy policy is to state what types of data are allowed for certain means of use. In fidesctl, a Policy is comprised of rules against which the system's privacy declarations are evaluated. Policies will evaluate the data subjects, data category, and data qualifier values against data use cases. This generates a boolean output to either allow or reject the process from proceeding. Policies use the following attributes: Name Type Description fides_key FidesKey An identifier label that must be unique within your organization. A fides_key can only contain alphanumeric characters and _ . data_categories List[DataRule] The types of sensitive data as defined by the taxonomy data_uses List[DataRule] The various categories of data processing and operations within your organization data_subjects List[DataRule] The individual persons to whom you data rule pertains data_qualifier String The acceptable or non-acceptable level of deidentification For more detail on Policy resources, see the full Policy resource documentation .
