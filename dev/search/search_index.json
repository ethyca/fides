In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected.</p> <ul> <li>Make sure your code doesn't not work</li> </ul> <p>It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken.</p> <p>This is especially important for a project like Fides, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code.

For example, to change the application's font to Courier:</p> <pre><code>* {\n  font-family: Courier !important;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Additionally, because this application uses CSS variables, you can modify those CSS variables directly, rather than adding custom CSS.</p> <p>The only caveat to this is that we need to do so in a way that overrides the CSS variables' original values so that we can avoid the complexity of modifying the JavaScript file that holds the base values.</p> <p>Our recommendation is that you do so by using selector specificity, as in the following example:</p> <pre><code>:root:root {\n  /* Changes the text color to red */\n  --chakra-colors-gray-600: #f00;\n\n  /* Changes the background color to blue */\n  --chakra-colors-gray-50: #00f;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Not exactly the most appealing color scheme \u2013 but note that wherever those variables are used, they have been replaced. This allows you to modify the theme of the application consistently and with a single source of truth, adhering to modern CSS best practices.</p>"}]}
