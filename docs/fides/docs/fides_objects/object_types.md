# Fides Object Types

This page describes the various objects that make up the Fides platform.

## Object Relationship Diagram

![alt text](../img/Object_Relations.svg "Fides Manifest Workflow")

## Organization

An organization is a logical grouping of objects, and all objects must belong to an organization. Fides includes a default organization with an id of 1.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    organization:
      fidesKey: "test_organization"
      name: "Test Organization"
      description: "A test organization used to check the validity of changes."
    ```

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fidesKey | String | A fides key is an identifier label that must be unique within your organizations systems. A fides key can only contain alphanumeric characters, '_', and '-' |
| name | String |  A name for this organization |
| description | String | A description of what this organiztion encapsulates |

---

## Privacy Classifiers

Fides uses four classifiers for describing how systems use privacy data, and for describing what privacy data can be used in what ways. All of these types support organization into hierarchical trees.

### Data Category

A Data Category describes the kind of data that is being used.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    data-category:
    - fidesKey: "date_of_birth"
      name: "Date of Birth"
      parentKey: "user_provided_data"
      description: "User's date of birth."
    ```

=== "Example Hierarchy"

    ```yaml
    - user_provided_data
        - date_of_birth
        - job_title
    - derived data
      - sensor_data
      - user_identifiable_data
        - telemetry_data
    - account data
        - account_contact_information
        - payment_information
    ```

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| organizationId | Optional[Int] | Id of the organization this data category belongs to, defaults to 1 |
| fidesKey | String | A fides key is an identifier label that must be unique within your organizations systems. A fides key can only contain alphanumeric characters, '_', and '-' |
| name | String |  A name for this data category |
| parentKey | Optional[String] | the fidesKey of the parent category |
| description | String | A description of what this data category means or encapsulates |

### Data Use

A Data Use describes what the data is being used for.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    data-use:
    - fidesKey: "provide_operational_support_for_contracted_service"
      name: "Provide Operational Support for Contracted Service"
      parentKey: "provide"
      description: "This usage is related to the acquisition, processing and storage of data about the usage of a cloud service (derived data) contracted by a specific cloud service customer in order to operate and protect the systems and processes necessary for the provision of this cloud service."
    ```

    ```yaml
    - personalize
    - share
        - share_when_required_to_provide_the_service
    - promote
        - promote_based_on_contextual_information
        - promote_based_on_personalization
    ```

    data-subject:
    - fidesKey: "anonymous_user"
      name: "Anonymous User"
      description: "A user without any identifiable information tied to them."
    ```

=== "Example Hierarchy"

    ```yaml

| parentKey | Optional[String] | the fidesKey of the parent category |
| description | String | A description of what this data subject means or encapsulates |

### Data Qualifier

A Data Qualifier describes how private the data being used is. The hierarchy for Data Qualifiers is in order of increasing exposure.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    data-qualifier:
    - fidesKey: "aggregated_data"
      name: "Aggregated Data"
      description: "Aggregated data is statistical data that does not contain individual-level entries and is combined from information about enough different persons that individual-level attribtures are not identifiable."
    ```

    system:
      - organizationId: 1
        fidesOrganizationKey: "Ethyca"
        registryId: 1

---

## Dataset

A Dataset represents any kind of place where data is stored and includes a sub-object that describes the fields within that dataset.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    dataset:
      - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "sample_db_dataset"
        name: "Sample DB Dataset"

## Policies

Policies group together sets of privacy rules into a single object. These are the objects that systems and registries will be evaluated against.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    policy:
      organizationId: 1
      fidesKey: "primaryPrivacyPolicy"
      privacyRules:
        - fidesKey: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
          dataCategories:
            inclusion: "ANY"
            values:
              - profiling_data
              - account_data
              - derived_data
              - cloud_service_provider_data
          dataUses:
            inclusion: ANY
            values:

### Privacy Rule

A Privacy Rule describes a single combination of data privacy classifiers that are acceptable or not.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fidesKey | String | A fides key is an identifier label that must be unique within your organizations systems. A fides key  can only contain alphanumeric characters, '_', and '-' |

| --- | --- | --- |
| inclusion | Choice | A string, either `ALL`, `NONE` or `ANY` |
| values | List[fidesKey] | A list of specific data privacy classifier fidesKeys |

### Policy Rule Application

Fides uses a matching algorithm to determine whether or not each Privacy Declaration is acceptable or not. The following are some examples of how it works.

=== "Matching Rule"

    ```yaml
    # Example Privacy Rule:

    - fidesKey: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
      dataCategories:
        inclusion: "ANY"
        values:
          - customer_content_data
          - cloud_service_provider_data
      dataUses:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - provide
          - market_advertise_or_promote
          - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
      dataSubjectCategories:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - trainee
          - commuter
      dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
      action: REJECT

    # Example Privacy Declaration:

    - dataCategories:
        - "customer_content_data"
      dataUses: "provide"
      dataSubjects:
        - "anonymous_user"
        - "commuter"
      dataQualifier: "psuedonymized_data"
      dataSets:
        - "user_data"

    # Example Evaluation Logic:

    - Do "ANY" of the dataCategories match?
        - Yes
    - Do "ANY" of the dataUses match?
        - Yes
    - Do "NONE" of the dataSubjects match?
        - Yes
    - Is the dataQualifier at the same level of exposure or higher?
        - Yes
    - Was the answer "yes" to all of the above questions?
        - Yes
    There is a match, and the Privacy Declaration evaluates to "REJECT"!
    ```

=== "Non-Matching Rule"

    ```yaml
    # Example Privacy Rule:

    - fidesKey: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
      dataCategories:
        inclusion: "ANY"
        values:
          - customer_content_data
          - cloud_service_provider_data
      dataUses:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - provide
          - market_advertise_or_promote
          - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
      dataSubjects:
        inclusion: NONE
        values:
          - trainee
          - commuter
      dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
      action: REJECT

    # Example Privacy Declaration:

    - dataCategories:
        - "customer_content_data"
      dataUses: "provide"
      dataSubjects:
        - "anonymous_user"
      dataQualifier: "anonymized_data"
      dataSets:
        - "user_data"

    # Example Evaluation Logic:

    - Do "ANY" of the dataCategories match?
        - Yes
    - Do "ANY" of the dataUses match?
        - Yes
    - Do "NONE" of the dataSubjects match?
        - Yes
    - Is the dataQualifier at the same level of exposure or higher?
        - No
    - Was the answer "yes" to all of the above questions?
        - No
    There is no match!
    ```

When evaluating against a policy, Fides evaluates all privacy rules and takes the _most_ restrictive position.

---

## Evaluation

Fides evaluates both systems and registries. Since a registry is a graph of systems, a registry evaluation is an evaluation of each individual system as well as a few additional checks on the graph as a whole.

When the evaluation of a registry or system is triggered, the following actions take place:

- If the privacy declarations are narrower than the declared privacy exposure of its dependent datasets, Fides generates a warning. For example, the system declares that it uses a dataset that includes "customer content data" at the "anonymized" level, but the system doesn't declare that it's exposing that.
- If the system's privacy declarations are narrower than the declared privacy exposure of a dependent system, we generate a warning. This is similar to the above restriction, except that we examine the privacy declarations of a dependent system rather than a dataset.
- For each policy rule we check each system declaration and take action on any declaration that falls within that policy rule's scope. For example, if a policy rule declares that **profiling_data** that is **identified_data** is disallowed, and the system contains a declaration that includes such data, an error will be generated.

Additionally, when a registry is evaluated, we also check that

- The registry system graph contains a dependency cycle (that is, **system_a** declares that it depends on **system_b** that declares that it depends on **system_a**).
- A system declares a dependency on a system that is not referenced in the registry.
