# Configuration

Fidesctl supports two methods of configuration. The first is via a toml file, and the second is via environment variables. They can also be used in tandem, with the environment variables overriding the toml configuration values.

The fidesctl CLI doesn't require a config file and will instead leverage the default values. These are very likely to be wrong however, so it is recommended to always configure your settings properly.


## Configuration file

After initializing fidesctl, a default configuration file will be generated and placed within the `.fides` directory. Here's an example of a default fidesctl configuration file:



```toml title="fidesctl.toml"
[database]
server="fidesctl-db"
user="postgres"
password="fidesctl"
port="5432"
db="fidesctl"
test_db="fidesctl_test"

[logging]
level = "INFO"
destination = ""
serialization = ""

[cli]
local_mode = False
server_host = "localhost"
server_port = 8080
server_protocol = "http"
analytics_id = ""

[user]
encryption_key = "test_encryption_key"
analytics_opt_out = false
```

To better describe the various configuration options, the following tables describe each available option, grouped by section:

=== "Database Section"

    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    | :----: | :----: | :-------: | :-----------: |
    | user | String | postgres | The username of the Postgres account. |
    | password | String | fidesctl | The password of the Postgres account. |
    | server | String | fidesctl-db | The hostname of the Postgres database server. |
    | port | String | 5432 | The port of the Postgres database server. |
    | db | String | fidesctl | The name of the Postgres database. |
    | test_db | String | ""| Used instead of the `db` config when the `FIDESCTL_TEST_MODE` environment variable is set to `True`, to avoid overwriting production data. | |

=== "Logging Section"
    | destination | String | "" | The output location for log files. Accepts any valid file path. If left unset, log entries are printed to `stdout` and log files are not produced. |
    | level | Enum (String) | INFO | The minimum log entry level to produce. Also accepts: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL` (case insensitive). |
    | serialization | Enum (String) | "" | The format with which to produce log entries. If left unset, produces log entries formatted using the internal custom formatter. Also accepts: `"JSON"` (case insensitive). |

=== "CLI Section"

    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    | :----: | :----: | :-------: | :-----------: |
    | local_mode | Boolean | False | When set to `True`, forbids the fidesctl CLI from making calls to the fidesctl webserver. |
    | server_host | String | localhost | The hostname of the fidesctl webserver. |
    | server_protocol | String | http | The protocol used by the fidesctl webserver. |
    | server_port | Integer | | The optional port of the fidesctl webserver. |
    | analytics_id | String | "" | A fully anonymized unique identifier that is automatically generated by the application and stored in the toml file. |

=== "User Section"

    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    | :----: | :----: | :-------: | :-----------: |
    | encryption_key | String | "" | An arbitrary string used to encrypt the user data stored in the database. Encryption is implemented using PGP. |
    | analytics_opt_out | Boolean | "" | When set to `true`, prevents sending anonymous analytics data to Ethyca. |


=== "Credentials Section"

The credentials section uses custom keys which can be referenced in certain commands. 

    | Name | Type | Default | Description |
    | :----: | :----: | :-------: | :-----------: |
    | my_postgres.connection_string | String | Required | Sets the connection_string for `my_postgres` database credentials |
    | my_aws.aws_access_key_id | String | Required | Sets the aws_access_key_id for `my_aws` credentials |
    | my_aws.aws_secret_access_key | String | Required | Sets the aws_secret_access_key for `my_aws` credentials |
    | my_aws.region_name | String | Required | Sets the region_name for `my_aws` credentials |
    | my_okta.orgUrl | String | Required | Sets the orgUrl for `my_okta` credentials |
    | my_okta.token | String | Required | Sets the token for `my_okta` credentials |

By default fidesctl will look for a `fidesctl.toml` configuration file in the following places:

1. At the path specified using the config file argument passed through the CLI
1. At the path specified by the `FIDES__CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
1. In the current working directory
1. In the parent working directory
1. Two directories up from the current working directory
1. The parent directory followed by /.fides
1. The user's home (~) directory

## Environment Variables

To configure environment variables for fidesctl, the following pattern is used:

```sh
FIDESCTL__<SECTION>__<VAR_NAME>
```

For example, if we want to set the `server_url` on a Linux machine we could use:

```sh
export FIDESCTL__CLI__SERVER_HOST="localhost"
export FIDESCTL__CLI__SERVER_PORT="8080"
export FIDESCTL__CLI__SERVER_PROTOCOL="http"
```
