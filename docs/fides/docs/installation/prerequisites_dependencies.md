# Prerequisites

Fidesctl is tested with (required for any part of fidesctl):

* Python: 3.8

Databases (required when running the fidesctl webserver):

* PostgreSQL: 12

All of these must be installed, either locally or via Docker, before attempting to run fidesctl as an application. The CLI is capable of running with only the Python dependency.
