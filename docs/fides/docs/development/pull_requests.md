# Pull Requests

---

Pull Requests are the primary unit of work within the Fides project. All code changes are expected to be submitted via a PR, and as such here are a few requirements for submitting PRs:

1. Completely fill out the provided pull request template
1. If you're unsure about a potential feature implementation or there is anything else that needs discussing, feel free to ask for an early review/feedback in the comments of the PR.
1. Make sure that all checks are passing and all boxes have been checked before passing it off to a reviewer for a final approval. PR reviews require other people to spend their time, so please be courteous and double check your work before passing it to a reviewer.
1. If there is a bug in a PR, fix it _within_ that PR, do not create another PR to fix a bug in a separate PR.
