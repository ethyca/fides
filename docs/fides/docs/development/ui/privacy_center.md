# Privacy Center

A web application built in Next.js to collect privacy requests from users: access, erasure, consent, and more!

---

## Development

To serve this application locally, first install your local dependencies at the root `client` directory level:

In `/clients`:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run:

```bash
cd privacy-center
turbo run dev
```

This will automatically build and run the project.

### Building

To build this application directly, run:

```bash
turbo run build
```

As a Next application, it will output build artifacts to the `.next` directory.

## API

The Privacy Center is a full-stack webserver but generally makes all it's API calls to the connected Fides server. However, it does host a small API of it's own that enables some basic "edge" functions like hosting a customized bundle of the `fides.js` script.

To view the OpenAPI documentation, run the application locally and visit the `/docs` page for details: <http://localhost:3000/docs>

## Testing

To run the interactive test interface, run:

```bash
turbo run test
```

For a fully-loaded development & test setup of both the Privacy Center, run the following commands in two separate terminals:

```bash
cd privacy-center && turbo run dev
cd privacy-center && turbo run cy:open
```

There are two ways to test Fides consent components:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/fides-js-components-demo.html`. This page comes pre-packaged with some default configurations to get up and running quickly with the consent components, and is also the page used by cypress e2e tests. To test other configurations, edit the fidesConfig object passed into `Fides.init()` in `privacy-center/public/fides-js-components-demo.html`.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/fides-js-demo.html`. This page, unlike the above, calls the `/api/fides-js` Privacy Center endpoint. This endpoint loads config from the privacy center's legacy `config.json`, so it's closer to how a customer would actually use the `fides-js` package. In addition, we inject only the minimal config into `fides-js`. The overlay is not enabled by default on this page.

## Deployment

To deploy this site, typically you should use the published `ethyca/fides-privacy-center` Docker image which is production-built Next.js image. See <https://docs.ethyca.com> for more!

## Configuration

You may configure the appearance of this web application at build time by modifying the `config.json` file inside the `config` directory. You're able to control:

- The header of the document
- The descriptive text of the document
- Which actions are present, and each action's:
  - Personally Identifying Information a user must submit
  - Title
  - Description
  - Icon
  - Policy key
- Whether consent management is enabled
- Consent options:
  - Personally Identifying Information a user must submit
  - Title
  - Description
  - Icon
  - Which consent management options are present, and each option's:
    - The Fides Data Use that the user may consent to
    - Descriptive information for the type of consent
    - The default consent state (opt in/out):
      - This can be a single boolean which will apply when the user has not modified their consent.
      - Or this can be an object with consent values that depend on the user's consent context, such as whether they are using Global Privacy Control. See [fides-js](../packages/fides-js/README.md#consent-context) for details.
    - The cookie keys that will be available to
      [fides.js](../packages/fides-js/README.md), which can be used to access a user's consent choices outside of the Privacy Center.
    - Whether the user's consent choice should be propagated to any configured third party services (executable). Note that currently, only one option may be marked `executable` at a time.

You can also add any CSS you'd like to the page by adding it to the `config.css` file inside the `config` directory.

Additionally, if you're handy with React and are feeling a little brave you can customize the entire application by modifying the TypeScript source code in `pages/index.tsx` and `components/RequestModal.tsx`.

### Configuring CSS

In order to modify the way your application appears visually, you can add custom css to the `config/config.css` file. For example, to change the application's font to Courier:

```css
* {
  font-family: Courier !important;
}
```

Additionally, because this application uses CSS variables, you can modify those CSS variables directly, rather than adding custom CSS.

The only caveat to this is that we need to do so in a way that overrides the CSS variables' original values so that we can avoid the complexity of modifying the JavaScript file that holds the base values.

Our recommendation is that you do so by using selector specificity, as in the following example:

```css
:root:root {
  /* Changes the text color to red */
  --chakra-colors-gray-600: #f00;

  /* Changes the background color to blue */
  --chakra-colors-gray-50: #00f;
}
```

Not exactly the most appealing color scheme â€“ but note that wherever those variables are used, they have been replaced. This allows you to modify the theme of the application consistently and with a single source of truth, adhering to modern CSS best practices.
