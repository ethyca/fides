# Documentation

Primary documentation for Fides now lives at <https://docs.ethyca.com>, however autogenerated documentation as well as developer documentation is still maintained and hosted within the [Fides project repo](https://github.com/ethyca/fides).

## Previewing Docs Locally

Documentation (including both developer documentation as well as API references) are built and deployed with every merge to Fides' main branch.

`nox -s docs_serve`

You'll see a status update as the docs build, and then an announcement that they are available at `localhost:8080/fides`.  The docs will hot-reload as changes are made, so there is no need to rerun the command whenever a change is made.
