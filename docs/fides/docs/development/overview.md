---

Thanks for contributing to Fides! This section of the docs is designed to help you become familiar with how we work, the standards we apply, and how to ensure your contribution is successful.

If you're stuck, don't be shy about asking for help [on GitHub](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues).

## Getting Started

### Clone Fides

To clone Fides for development, run `git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides`.

Once that is complete, you can use `make cli` to spin up a shell within a development docker environment. Your local application files will be loaded into the container and any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected in the container.

### Write your code

We have no doubt you can write amazing code! However, we want to help you ensure your code plays nicely with the rest of the Fides ecosystem. Many projects describe code style and documentation as a suggestion; in Fides it's a requirement.

- To learn how to style your code, see the [style guide](code_style.md).
- To learn how to document your code, see the [docs guide](documentation.md).
- To learn how to test your code, see the [tests guide](testing.md).
- To learn about contributing, see the [contribution guide](contributing.md).

### Submit your code

In order to submit code to Fides, please:

- [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) on your fork
- [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) once your work is ready for review
- Once automated tests have passed, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved. Once approved, your PR will be merged into Fides.
