# User Management

Fides users can be managed from the built-in control panel to create new accounts, and organize individual account access and permissions..
## Managing Users from the UI
The User Management panel displays a view of all users within the system, and provides a search bar for retrieving users by username. 

### Creating New Users
The `Add New User` button will walk through creating a new user.

### Managing User Privileges
