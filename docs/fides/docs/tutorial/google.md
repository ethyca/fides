# Add Google Analytics

To better understand the behavior of the app's users, add Google Analytics to the app and a fidesctl System resource to annotate it.

## Define the App's Google Analytics Identifier

Open the `flaskr/__init__.py` file in your favorite editor, and define the `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` constant below line 7:

```python
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID = "UA-xxxxxxxxx-y"
```

In the `create_app` function defined on line 11, include the Google Analytics ID value in the application's configuration by adding the following line below line 17:

```python
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID,
```

## Add the Google Analytics Script

Open the `flaskr/templates/base.html` file in your favorite editor, and include the following at the beginning of the `<head>` tag:

```html
{% if config['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID'] %}
    <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ config['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID'] }}"></script>
    <script>
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
        gtag("js", new Date());
        gtag("config", "{{ config['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID'] }}");
    </script>
{% endif %}
```

## Annotate a Fidesctl System Resource

To ensure that the app's policies can account for the data collected by Google Analytics, define a new fidesctl System resource by adding a `google_analytics_system.yml` file to the `fides_resources` directory. This System resource annotation should reflect the uses of the Google Analytics features configured in this app's implementation. Some things to think about might be:

* What fields are being tracked? (See the [field reference documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference) for a list of all possible fields)
* What `data_use` value would be appropriate for this app? (`provide` vs. `improve`)

For this System resource, the file should contain the following configuration:

```yml
system:
  - fides_key: google_analytics_system
    name: Google Analytics
    description: Hosted third party analytics to track and analyze user behaviour
    system_type: Third Party
    privacy_declarations:
      # See the Google Analytics documentation for a description of the possible
      # fields collected by the tracker, including page URL, referrer, cookie ID, etc.
      # https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference
      - name: Track & report on page views
        data_categories:
          - user.derived.identifiable.browsing_history
          - user.derived.identifiable.device.cookie_id
          - user.derived.identifiable.telemetry
          - user.derived.identifiable.location
          - user.derived.nonidentifiable
        data_use: improve
        data_subjects:
          - customer
        data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized
      # Google Analytics collects the user's IP address and derives geographic dimensions server-side.
      # See https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/realtime/dimsmets/geonetwork
      - name: Derive user geographic location
        data_categories:
          - user.derived.identifiable.device.ip_address
          - user.derived.identifiable.location
          - user.derived.identifiable
        data_use: improve
        data_subjects:
          - customer
        # With "IP Anonymization" enabled, IP addresses will be pseudonymized in Google Analytics
        # See https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/ip-anonymization
        data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized
```

There are two `privacy_declaration`s defined:

1. The use of pseudonymized behavioral data to analyze app usage
1. The use of user IP addresses to derive their geographic location

The two declarations reflect the separate purposes for which data is collected and used by Google Analytics here. They are meant to align with the app's actual usage of its specific Google Analytics implementation; there are many other data uses for Google Analytics, but this app does not leverage them.

## Check Your Progress

After making the above changes, your app should resemble the state of the [`ethyca/fidesdemo` repository](https://github.com/ethyca/fidesdemo) at the [`fidesctl-add-google-analytics` tag](https://github.com/ethyca/fidesdemo/releases/tag/fidesctl-add-google-analytics).

## Next: Manage Google Analytics with Fidesctl

Google Analytics is implemented and working correctly, but - oh no! - executing `make fidesctl-evaluate` shows a failure:

```json
{
  "fides_key": "4e739b1b_732e_43b1_8747_e833905dfc4c_1635789050",
  "status": "FAIL",
  "details": [
    "Declaration (Derive user geographic location) of System (google_analytics_system) failed Rule (Minimize User Identifiable Data) from Policy (flaskr_policy)"
  ],
  "message": null
}
```

In the final step, enable the fidesctl policy already in place to pass by [updating Google Analytics](pass.md).
