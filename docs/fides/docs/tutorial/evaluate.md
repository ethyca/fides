# Evaluate your Policy

_In this section, we'll review how to evaluate your policy and address any errors._

Now that we're done with all the setup, it's time to put your policy to the test!

## Run an Evaluation

Since we're running Fides locally, we can use the following command to evaluate our system:

```bash
fidesctl evaluate <path to resources>
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to see the evaluation result from just a single resource type, run:

```bash
fidesctl evaluate system <path to resource>
```

If that command returns a *PASS* evaluation, then you're now in a known-good state and ready to set up automated CI workflows to make sure your application remains compliant over time. If that command returns a *FAILED* evaluation, you should have received feedback as to why it failed.

Congratulations, you've now created your annotated datasets, system-level business cases, and your policy for enforcement â€” you've laid the groundwork for a comprehensive data privacy software program at your organization! This is a great starting point for training your peers and colleagues so they can evaluate their new code locally prior to committing any code to the repository.

## Next: Continuous Integration

The final step is to [integrate with your CI environment](ci.md) so you can fully realize Fides' potential. Allowing Fides `evaluate` calls to be triggered by your pipeline is critical for automatically assessing compliance at build time going forward.
