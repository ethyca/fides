# Annotate your Datasets
_In this section, we'll review what a dataset resource is, why it's needed, and how it's created and managed._

Fundamentally, your data ecosystem is built on data that is stored _somewhere_. In Fides, Datasets are used for granular, field-level annotations of exactly what data your systems are storing and where that data is stored. For example, you might declare one dataset for your Postgres application database, a second dataset for your Mongo orders collection, and a third dataset for some CSV files in cloud storage. The Dataset resource provides a database-agnostic way to annotate the fields stored in these systems with Data Categories, providing a metadata layer that other tooling can consume.

For Best Pizza Co, you can see the three Datasets, `postgres appdb`, `firestore auth`, and `redshift analyticsdb`, are aligned with data storage services in their data ecosystem:

At Best Pizza Co, we'll want to create a `dataset` resource for each of the 3 datasets above, starting with the Postgres Application DB.

## Generating a Dataset Resource

To create a dataset resource, you can either author a resource YAML file manually or use the `generate-dataset` CLI command. The CLI will connect to your database and automatically generate a non-annotated resource YAML file based on your database schema:

```
root@0419219d14e1:/fides/fidesctl# fidesctl generate-dataset postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@best-pizza-co.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres dataset1.yml
Generated dataset manifest written to dataset1.yml
```

Fidesctl has stored the structure of that database as a YAML file in the location provided (`dataset1.yml`). This file will serve as the first building block in creating Privacy as Code at the lowest level.

```yaml
dataset:
- fides_key: appdb
  organization_fides_key: default_organization
  name: Postgres App Database
  description: 'Fides Generated Description for Dataset: Postgres App Database'
  collections:
  - name: users
    description: 'Fides Generated Description for Table: users'
    fields:
    - name: first_name
      description: 'Fides Generated Description for Column: first_name'
      data_categories: []
    - name: zip_code
      description: 'Fides Generated Description for Column: zip_code'
      data_categories: []
```

## Understanding the Dataset Resource

This YAML serves as the foundation of the Fides language; it answers "_What data and kinds of data do we have?_" and "_How is our data organized?_". The language is built on declaring the types of data found in storage for your organization.

In traditional SQL, Fides defines the following:

* "datasets" as database schemas
* "collections" as database tables
* "fields" as database columns

For NoSQL datasets, Fides defines the following:
* "dataset"
* "collection" as a logical grouping of data fields (ie: in MongoDB, this is called a "Collection")
* "fields" as a reference to an individual data element (ie: in MongoDB, this is called a "field")

Additionally, fideslang has attributes that describe what kind of data is contained in this dataset. We use the following attributes to describe the data:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The name of this field |
| description | String | A description of what this field contains |
| data_categories | List[FidesKey] | The types of sensitive data, as defined by the taxonomy, that can be found in this field |
| data_qualifier | FidesKey | The level of deidentification for the dataset |

## Create Dataset Annotations

The `fidesctl generate-dataset` command has already pre-filled the required attributes for this exported YAML file. We can update the YAML file with some information that might be appropriate for your organization, such as:

```diff
 dataset:
 - fides_key: appdb
   organization_fides_key: default_organization
   name: Postgres App Database
+  description: 'This is our primary web application database'
-  description: 'Fides Generated Description for Dataset: Postgres App Database'
   collections:
     - name: users
+      description: 'Table that contains all user account data as entered by the user'
-      description: 'Fides Generated Description for Table: users'
       fields:
       - name: first_name
         description: 'Fides Generated Description for Column: first_name'
+        data_categories:
+        - user.provided.identifiable.name
+        data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified
-        data_categories: []
       - name: zip_code
         description: 'Fides Generated Description for Column: zip_code'
+        data_categories:
+        - user.provided.identifiable.contact.postal_code
+        data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized
-        data_categories: []
```

**PRO TIP**

As you're progressing with the tutorial, we recommend installing our [Fides' VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethyca.fidesctl), which will validate the syntax in real-time as you're writing your resource files!

## Maintaining a Dataset Resource

As your business grows, you will add more databases and other services where you will be storing potentially sensitive data. We recommend that updating this resource file become a part of the development process when building a new feature.

## Next: Systems
Now that we've seen how to annotate dataset resources (e.g. databases, flat-files) we can move up to the next layer: [Systems](system.md).
