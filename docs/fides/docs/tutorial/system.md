# Declare your Systems
_In this section, we'll review what a system resource is, why it's needed, and how it's created and managed._

Now that we've built out the underlying databases that describe how the data is stored and what type of data is there, we're going to start grouping these into application-level "systems", another critical Fides resource. 

For Best Pizza Co, you can see that they have 2 business-unit specific applications, `Web Application` and `Analytics`:

At Best Pizza Co, we'll have to create a `System` resource for each of the 2 systems above. 

## Understanding Systems
In Fides, Systems are used to model the applications, services, 3rd party APIs, etc that process data for your organization. Systems describe how these datasets are used for business functions around your organization. These dataset groupings are not mutually exclusive and answer the questions of "_How and why are these datasets being used?_" At Best Pizza Co, you might also have a "Marketing" system and a "Financial data database" (separate from the other dbs!), 

Systems use the following attributes: 

| Name | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| data_categories | List[FidesKey] | The data categories, or types of sensitive data as defined in the taxonomy |
| data_subjects | List[FidesKey] | The data subjects, or individual persons whose data resides in your datasets |
| data_use | List[FidesKey] | Data use describes the various categories of data processing and operations at your organization |
| data_qualifier | List[FidesKey] | Data qualifier describes the level of deidentification for the dataset |
| dataset_refereneces | List[FidesKey] | The fides_key(s) of the dataset fields used in this Privacy Declaration. |

As you can see, the System resource groups the lowest level of data (your datasets) with your business use cases and associates qualitative attributes describing what type of data is being used. 

## Creating a System Resource
Let's take a look at the following system annotations for a data analytics and marketing system:

```yaml
system:
  - fides_key: web_app
    name: Pizza Ordering Web Application
    description: A system used to order pizza from Best Pizza Co
    system_type: Service
    privacy_declarations:
      - name: Provide services and order tracking for customers.
        data_categories:
          - user.provided.identifiable.contact
        data_use: provide_product_or_service
        data_subjects:
          - customer
        data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified
        dataset_references:
          - appdb

  - fides_key: analytics
    name: Analytics system
    description: Provide BI and insights on customer, order and inventory data
    system_type: Service
    privacy_declarations:
      - name: Collect data for business intelligence
        data_categories:
          - user.provided.identifiable.contact
          - user.derived.identifiable.device
        data_use: improve_product_or_service
        data_subjects:
          - customer
        data_qualifier: aggregated.anonymized.unlinked_pseudonymized.pseudonymized.identified
```

As you can see, the system is comprised of Privacy Declarations. These can be read colloquially as "This system uses sensitive data types of `data_categories` for `data_subjects` with the purpose of `data_use` at a deidentification level of `data_qualifier`". 

You can create as many systems you'd like to cover all of your company's business applications. 

## Maintaining a System Resource
As business use cases evolve, your systems' data subjects, data categories and data uses will change with them. We recommend that updating this resource file become a regular part of the development planning process when building a new feature. 

As you add more systems to your ever-changing data ecosystem, you might want to consider grouping your systems into another Fides resource type, called a "Registry". This is just a logical grouping of Systems. 

## Next: Policy
With our datasets and systems in place, we've now declarated rich metadata about data privacy at Best Pizza Co. Now, we can enforce constraints on those declarations by writing [Policies](policy.md).
