# Development Overview

---

Thanks for contributing to fidesops! This section of the docs is designed to help you become familiar with how we work, the standards we apply, and how to ensure your contribution is successful.

If you're stuck, don't be shy about asking for help [on GitHub](https://github.com/ethyca/fidesops/issues).

## Getting started with fidesops in Docker

The recommended way to run fidesops is to launch it with Docker and Docker Compose. `Make` commands wrap docker-compose 
commands to give you different functionality.

### System Requirements 

1. Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install
2. [Create a fork of fidesops](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) 
3. Clone your fork `git clone https://github.com/<your-fork-location>/fidesops.git`
4. `cd fidesops`

### Available `nox` commands
An up-to-date list of build commands is available by running `nox` from within the project directory.
#### Issues 

- MSSQL: Known issues around connecting to MSSQL exist today for Apple M1 users. M1 users that wish to install `pyodbc` locally, please reference the workaround [here](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/846).

- Package not found: When running `nox -s dev`, if you get a `importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError: fidesops`, do `nox -s dev -- shell`, and then run `pip install -e .`. Verify fidesops is installed with `pip list`.


## Write your code

See the [contributing details](contributing_details.md) guide to get familiar with writing and testing API endpoints, database models, and more. 

We want to help you ensure your code plays nicely with the rest of the fidesops ecosystem. Many projects describe code style and documentation as a suggestion; in fidesops it's a CI-checked requirement.

* To learn how to style your code, see the [style guide](code_style.md).
* To learn how to document your code, see the [docs guide](documentation.md).
* To learn how to test your code, see the [tests guide](testing.md).
* To learn what format your PR should follow, make sure to follow the [pull request guidelines](pull_requests.md).


## Submit your code

In order to submit code to fidesops, please:

* [Fork the fidesops repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
* Add the original as a remote (I'm naming it `upstream`), to keep your fork in sync
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/ethyca/fidesops.git
  ```
* [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) on your fork
  ```bash
    git checkout main 
    git fetch upstream 
    git merge upstream/main 
    git push origin main 
    git checkout -b my-new-branch
    git push origin my-new-branch 
    ```
* [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) once your work is ready for review
  * Submit the pull request from *your* repo. Pull requests should be submitted with a clear description of the issue being handled, including links to any external specifications or Github issues. PRs should not be merged by the person submitting them, except in rare and urgent circumstances.
  * Once automated tests have passed, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved. Once approved, your PR will be merged into fidesops.
