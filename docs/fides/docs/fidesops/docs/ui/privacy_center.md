Each action is associated with a fidesops [policy key](../guides/policy_webhooks.md), which defines the policy executed when the DSR is approved.

Additional actions can be added to this list, and removed at any time.

Any overrides for CSS styling can be included in a `config.css` file in the `/privacy-center/config` directory.
