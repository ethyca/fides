## Going from Zero to Privacy Request in Ten Minutes

In this tutorial, we will be walking through the steps needed to execute a Privacy Request against an application.  We will
install fidesops in a test app and write a Python script that will make a series of API requests to fidesops to set up the
required configuration, like the connection to an app's database, the instructions on how to traverse its tables, and where 
to upload any data it finds.

Finally, we'll execute an access request to fetch all the data that our test application has collected about a customer.
