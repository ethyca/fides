# Fides

## Overview

Fides is a data privacy tool that lives within the `Software Development Life-Cycle`. It is designed to help companies stay compliant by briding the gap between compliance officers and engineers. By describing the flow of data within systems as Fides manifests, Fides is able to continually check for compliance and warn users of potentially unsafe changes before they make it into production.
