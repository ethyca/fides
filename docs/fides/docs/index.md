# Fides Documentation

Fides is a data privacy tool that lives within the `Software Development Life Cycle`. It is designed to help companies stay compliant by briding the gap between compliance officers and engineers. By describing the flow of data within systems as Fides manifests, Fides is able to continually check for compliance and warn users of potentially unsafe changes before they make it into production.

When data governance is documented in the source code by engineers, it makes it possible for organizations to handle data privacy in a proactive manner, instead of a reactive one.

## Principles

* Data Governance as YAML
* Compliance checks at the CI layer
* Synergy between engineers and lawyers

## Example

To make things more concrete, the following is a real-world example of how Fides supports proactive compliance with data privacy laws.
