# The Fides Ecosystem

Fides (pronounced */fee-dhez/*, from Latin: FidÄ“s) is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in your code.

The Fides developer tools allow engineers and legal teams to label system privacy characteristics, orchestrate programmatic rights fulfillment, and audit stored personal identifiable information (PII) throughout application systems and infrastructure. This includes support for major privacy regulations (e.g. [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/), [CCPA](https://ethyca.com/cpra-hub/) and [LGPD](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-new-brazilian-general-data-protection-law-a-detailed-analysis/)), and standards like [ISO 19944](https://www.iso.org/standard/79573.html) by default.
