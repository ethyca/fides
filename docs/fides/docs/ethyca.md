# About Ethyca
---
The mission of Ethyca is to make internet scale technology respectful and ethical. We're a venture backed privacy technology team headquartered in New York, but working as a distributed team across the US to solve what we believe is the most important problem in technology today, the human right to privacy in vastly complex data driven systems.

## What is Fides

Fides is a low friction set of dev tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines to make privacy a feature of your tech stack. Fides is a universally understandable, open source definition language on top of which we hope everyone can build better tools for the next decade.

## What we Believe

Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction filled and complicated. We're building open source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack.

## The Future

We've been working on this problem for three years already and have a clear view of our next five years. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments. 

This means building solutions for automated privacy analysis, as well as context rich data classification, automated data orchestration for privacy righs and semantic access control models. 

We'd love you to contribute to Fides and you can do this directyl as part of the open soure community or if you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software.[Join us now](https://ethyca.com/jobs-culture/) and get paid to work on this problem.

## Your Participation

Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement and an interopable standard for wide adoption. Your feedback, contributions and improvements are encouraged as we work towards building a community with the sole objective of building more repsectful software for everyone on the internet.
