# Fides Objects

## System

A system represents the privacy usage of a single software project or codebase

#### Fields

| name   |    type    |   description   |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| id  |  Int |  Generated unique id |
| organizationId  |  Int |  Id of the organization this system belongs to |
| fidesKey  |  String |  A fides key is an identifier label that must be unique within your organizations systems. A fides key  can only contain alphanumeric characters, '_', and '-'.|
| versionStamp  |  Int |    The version stamp is an incrementing number attached to your organization. It tracks the current version attached to your organization as any action is applied and can thus be used for "before/after" comparisons.  The version stamp is generated by the fides server. |
| fidesSystemType |  String |  A system type, API |
| declarations | List  |   A list of privacy declarations.  |
| systemDependencies |  List  | Systems that this system depends on, identified by their fidesKey |
| datasets |  Set  | Data sets that this system depends on, identified by their fidesKey |

#### Datasets

Aa dataset represents an annotated datastore (see below). It is ultimately made up of a collection of tables and fields. Each field declares a list of data categories it represents as well as a data qualifier.

If the privacy range of datasets is wider than that declared by this system a warning will be generated.

####  Dependent Systems

System dependencies are a graph, giving users the ability to describe that system `A` is dependent on systems `B` and `C`. Fides will then merge all of the systems' declarations and ensure that not only does system `A` perform in a compliant manner, but that systems `B` and `C` do as well.

#### Declarations

This individual system's privacy usage. Each declaration consists of

- A set of data categories
- A set of data subject categories
- A data use
- A data qualifier

 and can be read as "This system uses data in categories (data categories) (for [data subject categories]) with the purpose of (data use) at a qualified privacy level of (data qualifier)"
A system can have multiple declarations.

#### An example system

```   yaml
id:40
organizationId:1
fidesKey: bobco_service_api
versionStamp:123

```



## Dataset

A dataset represents a datastore. It consists of tables and field names, along with descriptions of the data category and qualifer held for each field. Data descriptions
for datastore fields do not contain data use or data subject category values, since
those related to the useage of data.

```yaml
dataset:
  - organizationId: 1
    fidesKey: "sample_db_dataset"
    name: "Sample DB Dataset"
    description: "This is a Sample Database Dataset"
    datasetType: "MySQL"
    location: "US East" # Geographic location of the dataset
    tables:
      - name: "sample_db_table_1"
        description: "Sample DB Table Description"
        fields:
          - name: "first_name"
            description: "A First Name Field"
            dataCategories:
              - "derived_data"
            dataQualifier: "identified_data"
          - name: "email"
            description: "User's Email"
            dataCategories:
              - "account_data"
            dataQualifier: "identified_data"
          - name: "Food Preference"
            description: "User's favorite food"
```



## Policies

### Policy rules

Aside from some identifing data, a policy is made up of a collection of rules. Each rule specifies an action:
a data qualifer as well as, for each of

```yaml
- data uses
- data categories
- data subject categories
both
- a list of values
- a qualifier (ANY, ALL, or NONE)
```

where something like, e.g.

```json
{
   "dataCategories":{
      "inclusion":"ANY",
      "values":[
         "account_data",
         "derived_data"
      ]
   }
}
```

means "this rule applies if the data categories being considered match ANY of "account_data", "derived_data" (child values are considered to be matching)

#### Policy Rule Actions

Currently

```yaml
- ACCEPT (accept if the policy matches)
- REJECT (reject if the policy matches)
- MANUAL (trigger a manual review process, TBD)
```

#### Policy Rule Application

A policy rule _applies_ to a system if

- the system matches the rule's categories
- the system matches the rule's uses
- the system matches the rule's data subject categories
- the system qualifier matches the rule's qualifier

To evaluate a system against a policy, we evaluate all rules and take the _most_ restricive interpretation.

### A Complete Policy


```yaml
policy:
  organizationId: 1
  fidesKey: "primaryPrivacyPolicy"
  rules:
    - organizationId: 1
      fidesKey: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
      dataCategories:
        inclusion: "ANY"
        values:
          - profiling_data
          - account_data
          - derived_data
          - cloud_service_provider_data
      dataUses:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - market_advertise_or_promote
          - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
      dataSubjectCategories:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - trainee
          - commuter

        values:
          - user_location
          - personal_health_data_and_medical_records
          - connectivity_data
          - credentials
      dataUses:
        inclusion: ALL
        values:
          - improvement_of_business_support_for_contracted_service
          - personalize
          - share_when_required_to_provide_the_service
      dataSubjectCategories:
        inclusion: NONE
        values:
          - trainee
          - commuter
          - patient
      dataQualifier: pseudonymized_data
      action: REJECT
```

## Approvals
We evaluate both systems and registries. Since a registry is essentially a graph of systems, a registry evaluation is just an evaluation of each individual system along with a few additional checks on the system graph as a whole.

When the evaluation of a system manifest is triggered, the following checks are run:

- If the systems privacy declarations are narrower than the declared privacy exposure of its dependent datasets, we generate a warning. For example, the system declares that it uses a dataset that includes "customer content data" at the "anonymized" level, but the system doesn't declare that it's exposing that.
- If the system's privacy declarations are narrower than the declared privacy exposure of a dependent system, we generate a warning. This is similar to the above restriction, except that we examine the privacy declarations of a dependant system rather than a dataset.
- For each policy rule we check each system declaration and take action on any declaration that falls within that policy rule's scope. For example, if a policy rule declares that **profiling_data** that is **identified_data** is disallowed, and the system contains a declaration that includes such data, an error will be generated.

Additionally, when a registry is evaluated, we also check that

- The registry system graph contains a dependency cycle (that is, **system_a** declares that it depends on **system_b** that declares that it depends on **system_a**).
- A system declares a dependency on a system that is not referenced in the registry.

## Privacy Classifiers

Fides uses four classifiers for describing how systems use privacy data, and for describing what privacy data can be used in what ways. All of these types are initially populated within the server but are extensible with custom values. All of these types support organization into hierarchical trees.

### Data category

=== "Yaml"

    ```yaml
    data-category:
    - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "customer_content_data"
        name: "Customer Content Data"

      # This field refers to the clause in the draft ISO-19944-1 that this is
      # derived from. This value is optional and custom hierarchies of data
      # categories are supported without any loss of functionality.
        clause: "8.8.2"
        description: "Customer content data is cloud service customer data extended to include similar data objects provided to applications executing locally on the device."
    ```

=== "An example hierarchy:"

    ```yaml
    - customer content data
        - credentials
        - personal health data
    - derived data
        - end user identifiable information
            - telemetry data
            - connectivity data
    - account data
        - account or administration contact information
        - payment instrument data
    ```

### Data use

=== "Yaml"

    ```yaml
    data-use:
    - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "personalize"
        name: "Personalize"
        description: "Personalize means to use specified data categories from the source scope to change the presentation of the capabilities of the result scope or to change the selection and presentation of data or promotions, etc."
    ```

=== "An example hierarchy:"

    ```yaml
    - personalize
    - share
        - share when required to provide the service
    - promote
        - promote based on contextual information
        - promote based on personalization
    ```


### Data Subject Category


=== "Yaml"

    ```yaml
    data-subject-category:
    - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "anonymous_user"
        name: "Anonymous User"
        description: "A user without any identifiable information tied to them."
    ```

=== "An example hierarchy:"


    ```yaml
    - customer
    - supplier
    - job applicant
    ```

### Data qualifier

=== "Yaml"

    ```yaml
    data-qualifier:
    - organizationId: 1
        fidesKey: "aggregated_data"
        name: "Aggregated Data"
        clause: "8.3.6"
        description: "Aggregated data is statistical data that does not contain individual-level entries and is combined from information about enough different persons that individual-level attribtures are not identifiable."
    ```

=== "An example hierarchy:"

    ```yaml
    - aggregated data
        - anonymized data
            - unlinked pseudonymized data
                - pseudonymized data
                    - identified data
    ```

Data qualifiers are sorted in order of increasing data exposure.
