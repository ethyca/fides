# API Reference

You can view the live, interactive [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/) API docs for Fidesctl by visiting `/docs` on a running instance. This is a great way to experiment with the APIs using Swagger's built-in "Try it out" functionality.

Below, we've embedded the latest release's API documentation as a living reference. These work largely the same, but since this documentation site isn't connected to a live instance, the "Try it out" and "Authorize" buttons won't work, sorry!
