# Getting Started with Fides Locally (without Docker)

---

Fidesctl can be spun up locally without relying on Docker or Make, however it is a bit more complicated. If you'd like something simpler, please see the [Getting Started with Docker](docker.md) guide for the recommended setup experience.

The guide for getting Fidesctl up and running locally is the same as is described in our [Deployment Guide](../deployment.md), so please head over there and follow the steps to get going.

## Next Steps

See the [Tutorial](../tutorial.md) page for a step-by-step guide on setting up a Fides data privacy workflow.
