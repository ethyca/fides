# Getting Started with Fides in Docker

The recommended way to get Fides running is to launch it using the supplied `make` commands. The `make` commands wrap `docker-compose` commands that will spin up each piece of the project.

## System Requirements

1. Install `make` locally (see [Make on Homebrew (Mac)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make), [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), or your preferred installation)
1. Install `docker` locally (see [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or your preferred installation; use a recent enough version so that `docker-compose` is also available)
1. Clone the [Fides repo](https://github.com/ethyca/fides) and `cd` into the `fides` directory

## Docker Setup

The following commands should all be run from the top-level `fides` directory (where the Makefile is):
1. `make init-db` -> Builds the require images, spins up the database, and runs the initialization scripts
```
~/git/fides% make init-db
Build the images required in the docker-compose file...
...
Building fidesapi
...
Building fidesctl
...
Building docs
...
Reset the db and run the migrations...
...
Tearing down the dev environment...
...
Teardown complete
```
2. `make cli` -> This will spin up the entire project and open a shell within the `fidesctl` container, with the `fidesapi` being accessible. This command will "hang" for a bit, as `fidesctl` will wait for the API to be healthy before launching the shell. Once you see the `fidesctl#` prompt, you know you're ready to go:
```
~/git/fides% make cli
Build the images required in the docker-compose file...
...
Building fidesapi
...
Building fidesctl
...
Building docs
...
Check for new migrations to run...
...
root@1a742083cedf:/fides/fidesctl#
```
3. `fidesctl ping` -> This confirms that your `fidesctl` CLI can reach the server and everything is ready to go!
```
root@796cfde906f1:/fides/fidesctl# fidesctl ping
Pinging http://fidesapi:8080...
Ping Successful!
```

## Next Steps

Now that you're up and running, you can use `fidesctl` from the shell to get a list of all the possible CLI commands. You're now ready to start enforcing privacy with Fides!
