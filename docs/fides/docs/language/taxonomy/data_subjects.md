# Data Subjects Reference

A Data Subject is a label that describes a segment of  individuals whose data you store. Data Subject labels are typically fairly broad -- "Citizen", "Visitor", "Passenger", and so on -- although you be as specific as your system needs: "Fans in Section K", for example.

!!! Note "Extensibility and Interopability"
    Data Subjects in Fides are designed to support common privacy regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944.

    You can extend the taxonomy to support your organization's needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing categories to ensure interopability inside and outside your organization.

    If you have suggestions for core categories that should ship with the taxonomy, please submit your requests [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues)
