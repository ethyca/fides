# Data Categories Reference

Data Categories are hierarchical labels used to describe the type of data processed by your software. Data Category objects form a hierarchy: A Data Category can contain any number of children, but a given Category may only have one parent. You assign a child Category to a parent by setting the child's `parent_key` property. For example, the `user.provided.identifiable.job_title` Category is used for personally-identifiable job title information that was provided by the user.

 These are most heavily used by the System and Dataset resources, where you can assign one or more data categories to each field.

## Object Structure

**fides_key**<span class="required"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_constrained string_

A string token that uniquely identifies this Data Category. The value is a dot-separated concatenation of the `fides_key` values of the resource's ancestors plus a final element for this resource:

`grandparent.parent.this_data_category`

The final element (`this_data_category`) may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`[A-Za-z0-9_.-]`). The dot character is reserved as a separator.

**name**<span class="spacer"/>_string_

A UI-friendly label for the Data Category.

**description**<span class="spacer"/>_string_

A human-readable description of the Data Category.

**parent_key**<span class="spacer"/>_string_<span class="spacer"/>

The fides key of the the Data Category's parent.

**organization_fides_key**<span class="spacer"/>_string_<span class="spacer"/>default: `default_organization`

The fides key of the organization to which this Data Category belongs.

!!! Note "Extensibility and Interopability"
    Data Categories in Fides are designed to support common privacy regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944.

    You can extend the taxonomy to support your system needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing categories to ensure interopability inside and outside your organization.

    If you have suggestions for core categories that should ship with the taxonomy, please submit your requests [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues)

## Top Level Data Categories

There are three top-level categories:

| Label     | Parent Key    | Description                                           |
| ---       | ---           | ---                                                   |
| `account` | `-`           | Data related to an account on the system.             |
| `system`  | `-`           | Data unique to, and under control of the system.      |
| `user`    | `-`           | Data related to the user of the system.               |

For each top level category there are multiple subcategories that provide richer context.

Below is a reference for all subcategories of `account`, `system` and `user` to assist with describing all data across systems.

## Account Data Categories

## User Data Categories

The "User" data category has two important subcategories for `derived` and `provided` data.

In turn, `derived` and `provided` both have subcategories for `identifiable` and `nonidentifiable` data, to make it clear what data is considered identifiable in your systems.

### User Derived Data

Data derived from user provided data or as a result of user actions in the system.
