# Data Uses Reference

A Data Use is a label that denotes the way data is used in your system: "Advertising, Marketing or Promotion", "First Party Advertising", and "Sharing for Legal Obligation", as examples.

Data Use objects form a hierarchy: A Data Use can contain any number of children, but a given Data Use may only have one parent. You assign a child Data Use to a parent by setting the child's `parent_key` property. For example, the `third_party_sharing.personalized_advertising` Data Use type is data used for personalized advertising when shared with third parties.

## Object Structure

**fides_key**<span class="required"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_constrained string_

A string token that uniquely identifies this Data Use. The value is a dot-separated concatenation of the `fides_key` values of the resource's ancestors plus a final element for this resource:

`grandparent.parent.this_data_use`

The final element (`this_data_use`) may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`[A-Za-z0-9_.-]`). The dot character is reserved as a separator.

**name**<span class="spacer"/>_string_

A UI-friendly label for the Data Use.

**description**<span class="spacer"/>_string_

A human-readable description of the Data Use.

**parent_key**<span class="spacer"/>_string_<span class="spacer"/>

The fides key of the the Data Use's parent.

**organization_fides_key**<span class="spacer"/>_string_<span class="spacer"/>default: `default_organization`

The fides key of the organization to which this Data Use belongs.

!!! Note "Extensibility and Interopability"
    Data Uses in Fides are designed to support common privacy regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944.

    You can extend the taxonomy to support your organization's needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing categories to ensure interopability inside and outside your organization.

    If you have suggestions for core categories that should ship with the taxonomy, please submit your requests [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues)

## Top Level Data Uses

There are seven top-level Data Use classes:

For each top level classification there are multiple subclasses that provide richer context.
Below is a reference for all subclasses of `account`, `system` and `user` to assist with describing all data across systems.

### Collection & AI Training Data Uses

In the case of `collection` and `train_ai_system`, you will see these have no subclasses at present however define very specific data use cases that should be captured in data processes if they occur.

| Label                | Parent Key  | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
