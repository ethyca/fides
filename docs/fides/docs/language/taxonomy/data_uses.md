# Data Uses Reference

Data Uses are labels that describe how, or for what purpose(s) a component of your system is using data.

!!! Note "Extensibility and Interopability"
    Data Uses in Fides are designed to support common privacy regulations and standards out of the box, these include GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and ISO 19944. 
    
    You can extend the taxonomy to support your organization's needs. If you do this, we recommend extending from the existing categories to ensure interopability inside and outside your organization.

    If you have suggestions for core categories that should ship with the taxonomy, please submit your requests [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues)


## Top Level Data Uses

There are seven top-level Data Use classes:

For each top level classification there are multiple subclasses that provide richer context.
Below is a reference for all subclasses of `account`, `system` and `user` to assist with describing all data across systems.

### Collection & AI Training Data Uses

In the case of `collection` and `train_ai_system`, you will see these have no subclasses at present however define very specific data use cases that should be captured in data processes if they occur. 

| Label                | Parent Key  | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
