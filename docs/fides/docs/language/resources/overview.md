# Fides Resource Types

You define your privacy policies by creating sets of resources. There are nine resource types divided into two groups:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Group</th>
      <th>Resource types</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Structure</td>
      <td>Organization<br>Policy<br>System<br>Registry<br>Dataset</td>
      <td>Provides a structure for your policies and the data to which they're applied.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data</td>
      <td>Data category<br>Data use<br>Data subject<br>Data qualifier</td>
      <td>The elements that you use to create a privacy policy. These resources describe the conditions in which a specific type of user is allowed to view a particular type of data.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
