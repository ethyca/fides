# Extending Data Use


This page provides an overview of extending the [Data Use taxonomy](/fides/language/taxonomy/data_uses) for your organization. We recommend extending from the existing categories to ensure interopability inside and outside your organization.

One of the core reasons for extending a Data Use is adding attribution to be used when exporting data from Fides and adding context/clarity for legal teams.

If you have suggestions for core categories that should ship with the taxonomy, please submit your requests [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues)

## Creating your custom Data Use

```yaml title="data_use.yml"
data_use:
  - fides_key: third_party_sharing.legal_obligation.payroll
    name: Payroll
    description: Legally obliged sharing of payroll information
    recipients: 
    - HMRC
    - IRS
    - NYDTF
    legal_basis: Legal Obligation
    parent_key: third_party_sharing.legal_obligation
  - fides_key: third_party_sharing.personalized_advertising.direct_marketing
    name: Direct Marketing
    description: Consented user information for direct marketing purposes
    recipients: 
    - Processor - marketing co. 
    legal_basis: Consent
    parent_key: third_party_sharing.personalized_advertising
```

The above example uses the existing `demo_data_use.yml` from the Fides project. Further details for each field are below:

* `fides_key`: Ideally extended from the existing taxonomy using the dot (`.`) separator
* `name`: The name used here will also be surfaced as the **purpose of processing** when exporting data from Fides
* `description`: An optional description of the purpose of processing
* `recipients`: A list of recipients of personal data for this data use, our Payroll example above has multiple recipients for tax purposes
* `legal_basis`: The legal basis category for processing, used as part of exporting data from Fides. 
* `parent_key`: The parent Data Use fides key extended from
