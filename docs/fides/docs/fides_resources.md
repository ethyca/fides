# Fides Resource Types

This page describes the various resources that make up the Fides platform.

## Resource Relationship Diagram

![alt text](img/Resource_Relations.svg "Fides Manifest Workflow")

## Organization

An organization is a logical grouping of resources, and all resources must belong to an organization. Fides includes a default organization with an id of 1.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    organization:
      fides_key: "test_organization"
      name: "Test Organization"
      description: "A test organization used to check the validity of changes."
    ```

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fides_key | FidesKey | A fides key is an identifier label that must be unique within your organization. A fides_key can only contain alphanumeric characters and '_' |
| name | String |  A name for this organization |
| description | String | A description of what this organiztion encapsulates |

---

## Privacy Classifiers

Fides uses four classifiers for describing how systems use privacy data, and for describing what privacy data can be used in what ways. All of these types support organization into hierarchical trees.

### Data Category

A Data Category describes the kind of data that is being used.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    data_category:
    - fides_key: "date_of_birth"
      name: "Date of Birth"
      parent_key: "user_provided_data"
      description: "User's date of birth."
    ```

=== "Example Hierarchy"

    ```yaml
    - user_provided_data
        - date_of_birth
        - job_title
    - derived data
      - sensor_data
      - user_identifiable_data
        - telemetry_data
    - account data
        - account_contact_information
        - payment_information
    ```

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| organization_parent_key | Optional[Int] | Id of the organization this data category belongs to, defaults to 1 |
| fides_key | FidesKey | A fides key is an identifier label that must be unique within your organization. A fides_key can only contain alphanumeric characters and '_' |
| name | String |  A name for this data category |
| parent_key | Optional[FidesKey] | the fides_key of the parent category |
| description | String | A description of what this data category means or encapsulates |

### Data Use

A Data Use describes what the data is being used for.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    data_use:
    - fides_key: "provide_operational_support_for_contracted_service"
      name: "Provide Operational Support for Contracted Service"
      parent_key: "provide"
      description: "This usage is related to the acquisition, processing and storage of data about the usage of a cloud service (derived data) contracted by a specific cloud service customer in order to operate and protect the systems and processes necessary for the provision of this cloud service."
    ```

=== "Example Hierarchy"

    ```yaml
    - personalize
    - share
        - share_when_required_to_provide_the_service

    data_subject:
    - fides_key: "anonymous_user"
      name: "Anonymous User"
      description: "A user without any identifiable information tied to them."
    ```

=== "Example Hierarchy"

    ```yaml

| name | String | A name for this data subject |
| description | String | A description of what this data subject means or encapsulates |

### Data Qualifier

A Data Qualifier describes how private the data being used is. The hierarchy for Data Qualifiers is in order of increasing exposure.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    data_qualifier:
    - fides_key: "aggregated_data"
      name: "Aggregated Data"
      description: "Aggregated data is statistical data that does not contain individual-level entries and is combined from information about enough different persons that individual-level attribtures are not identifiable."

---

## Dataset

A Dataset represents any kind of place where data is stored and includes a sub-resource that describes the fields within that dataset.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    dataset:
      - organization_parent_key: 1
        fides_key: "sample_db_dataset"

## Policies

Policies group together sets of privacy rules into a single resource. These are the resources that systems and registries will be evaluated against.

=== "Example Manifest"

    ```yaml
    policy:
      organization_parent_key: 1
      fides_key: "primary_privacy_policy"
      privacy_rules:
        - fides_key: "reject_targeted_marketing"
          data_categories:
            inclusion: "ANY"
            values:
              - profiling_data
              - account_data
              - derived_data

| values | List[FidesKey] | A list of specific data privacy classifier fides_keys |

### Policy Rule Application

Fides uses a matching algorithm to determine whether or not each Privacy Declaration is acceptable or not. The following are some examples of how it works.

=== "Matching Rule"

    ```yaml
    # Example Privacy Rule:

    - fides_key: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
      data_categories:
        inclusion: "ANY"
        values:
          - customer_content_data
          - cloud_service_provider_data
      data_uses:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - provide
          - market_advertise_or_promote
          - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
      data_subjects:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - trainee
          - commuter
      data_qualifier: pseudonymized_data
      action: REJECT

    # Example Privacy Declaration:

    - data_categories:
        - "customer_content_data"
      data_uses: "provide"
      data_subjects:
        - "anonymous_user"
        - "commuter"
      data_qualifier: "psuedonymized_data"
      datasets:
        - "user_data"

    # Example Evaluation Logic:

    - Do "ANY" of the dataCategories match?
        - Yes
    - Do "ANY" of the dataUses match?
        - Yes
    - Do "NONE" of the dataSubjects match?
        - Yes
    - Is the dataQualifier at the same level of exposure or higher?
        - Yes
    - Was the answer "yes" to all of the above questions?
        - Yes
    There is a match, and the Privacy Declaration evaluates to "REJECT"!
    ```

=== "Non-Matching Rule"

    ```yaml
    # Example Privacy Rule:

    - fides_key: "rejectTargetedMarketing"
      data_categories:
        inclusion: "ANY"
        values:
          - customer_content_data
          - cloud_service_provider_data
      data_uses:
        inclusion: ANY
        values:
          - provide
          - market_advertise_or_promote
          - offer_upgrades_or_upsell
      data_subjects:
        inclusion: NONE
        values:
          - trainee
          - commuter
      data_qualifier: pseudonymized_data
      action: REJECT

    # Example Privacy Declaration:

    - data_categories:
        - "customer_content_data"
      data_uses: "provide"
      data_subjects:
        - "anonymous_user"
      data_qualifier: "anonymized_data"
      datasets:
        - "user_data"

    # Example Evaluation Logic:

    - Do "ANY" of the dataCategories match?
        - Yes
    - Do "ANY" of the dataUses match?
        - Yes
    - Do "NONE" of the dataSubjects match?
        - Yes
    - Is the dataQualifier at the same level of exposure or higher?
        - No
    - Was the answer "yes" to all of the above questions?
        - No
    There is no match!
    ```

When evaluating against a policy, Fides evaluates all privacy rules and takes the _most_ restrictive position.
