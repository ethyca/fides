# Outline


Let's sketch out a Python file in `fidesdemo/flaskr/fidesops.py` where we'll add functions that use Python's [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
library to call the `fidesops` API to build our required configuration.

As we go through each step in the tutorial, you'll add a couple of helper methods that are wrappers to API calls, and
then add calls to these functions at the bottom to be executed when we run this script.

Create the file `fidesdemo/flaskr/fidesops.py` and add the following imports, environment variables,
and outline the methods we'll be creating together: 
```python
import logging
import requests
import yaml
from datetime import datetime

logging.basicConfig()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# For tutorial simplicity. In prod, this should go in an ENV file or similar.
FIDESOPS_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
ROOT_CLIENT_ID = "fidesopsadmin"
ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET = "fidesopsadminsecret"
POSTGRES_SERVER = "db"
POSTGRES_USER = "postgres"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "postgres"
POSTGRES_PORT = "5432"

# We'll define some functions here:


if __name__ == "__main__":
    """We'll add calls to our functions here"""

    # TODO Create a new OAuth client to use for our app

    # TODO Connect to our PostgreSQL database

    # TODO Upload the dataset YAML for our PostgreSQL schema

    # TODO Configure a Storage Config to upload the results

    # TODO Create a Policy that returns all user data

    # TODO Execute a Privacy Request for user@example.com
