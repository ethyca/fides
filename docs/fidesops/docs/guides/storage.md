# Configure Storage Destinations

## Overview

Access requests will produce a data package upon completion. This data will need to be uploaded to a storage destination (e.g. an S3 bucket). 

Fidesops never stores privacy request results locally, so youâ€™ll need to configure at least one storage destination if you wish to process Access requests.

Storage destinations are configured on Rules. 

![Storage Destinations](../img/storage_destinations.png "Storage Destinations")

Multiple destinations can be configured, each of which might be used by different rules. Read more about configuring rules [here](./policies.md)

Each unique destination is configured using a "StorageConfig", which you can create and manage via the API.

To configure a StorageConfig, you'll first need to choose a storage destination type. fidesops currently supports the following types:

- **local** - This saves upload packages locally, generating a `fides_uploads` directory at the root of this project. This destination type should be used only for testing purposes, never to process real-world access requests.
- **S3** - S3 upload is straightforward, in which files are uploaded in an S3 bucket of your choosing upon completion of access requests. Use S3 if you simply need a place to store those files.
- **OneTrust** - A OneTrust storage destination should be configured if you wish to use fidesops to process requests from an existing OneTrust integration. Read more about how our OneTrust integration works [here](./onetrust.md)

## Configuration

Let's get started. To create a new StorageConfig, use the following endpoint ([API docs here](/fidesops/api#operations-Storage-put_config_api_v1_storage_config_put)):

```json title="<code>PATCH {host}/api/v1/storage/config</code>" 
  {
    "destinations": [
      {
        "name": str,
        "key": FidesOpsKey (optional),
        "type": str,
        "format": str
        "details": {
          # s3
          "bucket": str,
          "naming": str,
          # onetrust
          "service_name": str,
          "onetrust_polling_hr": int,
          "onetrust_polling_day_of_week": int
        }
      }
    ]
  }

```
Params:

- `name`: A unique user-friendly name for your storage destination.
- `key`: A unique key used to manage your storage destination. This is auto-generated from `name` if left blank. Accepted values are alphanumeric, `_`, and `.`.
- `type`: Type of storage destination. Supported types include `s3`, `onetrust`, and `local`. You may configure multiple destinations of the same type.
- `format`: Format of uploaded data. Supported formats include `json` and `csv`. For OneTrust and local destination types, use `json`.

Additional params needed for S3:

- `bucket`: Name of bucket in S3.
- `naming`: This defines how the uploaded files will be named. Currently, fidesops only supports upload file naming by `request_id`. Use this value for all your storage destinations. 

Additional params needed for OneTrust:

- `service_name`: Name of your service / company. This informs OneTrust from where the data obtained from a given access request originated.
- `onetrust_polling_hr`: Hour, in UTC timezone, at which to poll OneTrust for new requests. Accepts an int from 0-23, where 0 is midnight. E.g. `7` is 7am UTC.
- `onetrust_polling_day_of_week`: Day on which to poll OneTrust for new requests. Accepts an int from 0-6 where 0 is Sunday. E.g. `1` is Monday.

Additional params needed for local:

- `naming`: This defines how the uploaded files will be named. Currently, fidesops only supports upload file naming by `request_id`. Use this value for all your storage destinations.

On success, the response from the above endpoint will include a `storage_key` for each destination. 


```json title="Example response"
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "sto_fe4e4dc0-b5d3-4ac1-bfcd-86e60e9891b9",
            "name": "s3 storage 2",
            "type": "s3",
            "details": {
                "bucket": "my-bucket",
                "naming": "request_id",
                "object_name": "requests"
            },
            "key": "s3_storage_2"
        }
    ],
    "total": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "size": 1
}
```

## Authentication

Next, you'll need to authenticate secrets with the specific storage destination.

Authentication is not needed for the `local` destination type.

Use the `storage_key` obtained from above in the following endpoint ([API docs here](/fidesops/api#operations-Storage-put_config_secrets_api_v1_storage_config__config_key__secret_put)): 

```json title="<code>PUT {host}/api/v1/storage/config/{storage_key}/secret</code>"
  {
    # s3
    "aws_access_key_id": str,
    "aws_secret_access_key": str
    # onetrust
    "onetrust_hostname": str
    "onetrust_client_id": str
    "onetrust_client_secret": str
  }

```

Params needed for S3:

  - `aws_access_key_id`: AWS access key id, obtained from AWS console.
  - `aws_secret_access_key`: AWS secret access key, obtained from AWS console.

Params needed for OneTrust:

  - `onetrust_hostname`: Your unique OneTrust hostname, used to call OneTrust REST APIs, e.g. `my-company.onetrust`
  - `onetrust_client_id`: OneTrust client id, obtained from OneTrust portal.
  - `onetrust_client_secret`: OneTrust client id, obtained from OneTrust portal.

Currently, we do not save the secrets if credentials fail authentication with the given storage destination.

## Testing

To test that your storage destination works correctly, you may hit the upload endpoint directly, where `request_id` in the path is an arbitrary string.

Keep in mind that OneTrust destinations will need to be tested end-to-end, using the OneTrust interface to approve a test privacy request. 

To upload data to a storage destination of choice ([api docs here](/fidesops/api#operations-Storage-upload_data_api_v1_storage__request_id__post)):

```json title="<code>PUT {host}/api/v1/storage/{request_id}</code>"
  {
    "storage_key": {storage_key},
    "data": {
      # data here
    }
  }

```

Params:

- `storage_key`: key associated with the storage destination
- `data`: dict of arbitrary data you wish to upload to storage destination.


## Extensibility

Need a different storage destination? Fidesops can be extended to support additional storage destinations by:
 
1. Add destination-specific enums in `src/fidesops/schemas/storage/storage.py`
2. Implement an authenticator in `src/fidesops/service/storage/storage_authenticator_service.py`
3. Implement the uploader in `src/fidesops/service/storage/storage_uploader_service.py`
