Fidesops' SaaS configuration supports authentication via `oauth2`. For more authentication options, see the [config guide](./saas_config.md#client-config).

!!! Tip "Fidesops currently supports the [Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) flow, with additional methods planned for the future."

This authentication strategy has the following configuration values:

- `authorization_request`: The request to build the URL that is presented to the user to authenticate this connection.
- `token_request`: The request made to retrieve the access token after the authorization code is returned via the `/oauth/callback` endpoint.
- `refresh_request` (_optional_): The request to refresh an access token.
- `expires_in` (_optional_): The lifetime of an access token (in seconds). This is used if the OAuth2 workflow in use does not provide expiration information ([RFC 6749 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.1)).

## Sample Configuration
Each OAuth2 request is fully configurable to account for the different ways the parameters can be mapped to a request. The following examples demonstrate the requests generated from sample configuration files.
 
```yaml title="OAuth2 authentication strategy"
authentication:
  strategy: oauth2
  configuration:
    authorization_request:
      ...
    token_request:
      ...
    refresh_request:
      ...
```

### Authorization Request
```yaml
authorization_request:
    method: GET
    path: /auth/authorize
    query_params:
    - name: client_id
        value: <client_id>
    - name: redirect_uri
        value: <redirect_uri>
    - name: response_type
        value: code
    - name: scope
        value: <scope>
    - name: state
        value: <state>
```

The above `authentication_request` will generate the following:

```text title="GET request"
https://<domain>/auth/authorize?client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&response_type=code&scope=<scope>&state=<state>
```

The placeholders are sourced from the values defined in the [`connector_params`](saas_config.md#connector-params) of your SaaS config. 

The `<state>` placeholder is generated automatically with each authorization request. This authorization URL can be retrieved by calling:

```text title="GET request"
https://{{domain}}/api/v1/connection/{{connection_key}}/authorize
```

### Token Request
```yaml
token_request:
    method: POST
    path: /oauth/token
    query_params:
    - name: client_id
        value: <client_id>
    - name: client_secret
        value: <client_secret>
    - name: grant_type
        value: authorization_code
    - name: code
        value: <code>
```

The `<code>` placeholder is defined automatically by Fidesops. 

The above `token_request` configuration generates the following:

```text title="GET Request"
https://<domain>/oauth_token?client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>&grant_type=authorization_code&code=<code>
```

This request is called automatically after Fidesops receives a callback response to the `https://{{domain}}/api/v1/oauth/callback` endpoint.

#### Refresh Request
```yaml
refresh_request:
    method: POST
    path: /oauth/token
    query_params:
    - name: client_id
        value: <client_id>
    - name: client_secret
        value: <client_secret>
    - name: grant_type
        value: refresh_token
    - name: refresh_token
        value: <refresh_token>
```

The `<refresh_token>` placeholder is defined automatically by Fidesops. 

The above `refresh_request` configuration generates the following:

```
GET https://<domain>/oauth_token?client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>&grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<refresh_token>
```

This is called automatically when the `access_token` is about to expire. The expiration is usually defined in the response to the token request. If the expiration is not returned by the API, it can be specified manually by setting the `expires_in` field (which is defined in seconds):

```yaml
authentication:
  strategy: oauth2
  configuration:
    expires_in: 3600
    authorization_request:
      ...
    token_request:
      ...
    refresh_request:
      ...
```

## Usage Checklist
To use OAuth2 as a connection strategy, the following must be configured first:

#### One-time configuration
- A callback server or network rules are required to forward the callback response from the SaaS providers to an instance of Fidesops. This is dependent on the user environment where Fidesops is deployed, and is out of scope for this documentation.
- These incoming requests must be routed to `https://{{host}}/api/v1/oauth/callback`.

#### Per-connector configuration
- Fidesops must be able to connect to the SaaS provider (Outreach, Salesforce, etc.).
- A **Client ID** and **Client Secret** must be generated within the SaaS providerâ€™s admin console.
    - This is dependent on the individual SaaS provider. Refer to the provider's documentation.
- The **Redirect URI** must be registered within the SaaS provider's admin console.
- The connector using OAuth2 is configured using the steps for [how to configure a SaaS connector](../saas_connectors/#how-to-configure-a-saas-connector).
- The OAuth2 workflow is initialized by following the URL returned from `https://{{domain}}/api/v1/connection/{{connection_key}}/authorize`.
