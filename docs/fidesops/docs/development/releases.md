# Releases

---

Fides uses semantic versioning. Each release version has a corresponding GitHub Project assigned to it. Issues are then assigned to them as a way to determine what new features/bug fixes will be included in each release.

When a release project is complete, a new version is cut using GitHub's release page [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fidesops/releases). This will trigger a GitHub Action that pushes the new version to PyPi.

Hotfixes are an exception to this and can be added and pushed mid-release as needed.
